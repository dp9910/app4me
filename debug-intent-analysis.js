Analyze this user query and determine exactly what type of app they want: "${query}"

You need to be VERY SPECIFIC about what they're looking for. Don't match generic keywords.

For example:
- "learn to take care of plants" ‚Üí They want PLANT CARE apps, not language learning apps
- "help me budget" ‚Üí They want FINANCE/BUDGETING apps, not general help apps
- "find food near me" ‚Üí They want FOOD/RESTAURANT apps, not general discovery apps

Return JSON with:
- user_goal: What the user wants to accomplish (specific, not generic)
- app_type: Specific type of app they need (e.g., "plant care", "budget tracker", "plant identification")
- specific_features: What features the app should have (3-5 items)
- avoid_categories: Categories that would be irrelevant (3-5 items)
- search_terms: {
    app_names: Specific app names that might match (3-5 examples)
    exact_keywords: Exact keywords to search for in titles (3-5 terms)
    category_keywords: Categories to focus on (2-3 categories)
  }
- confidence: How confident you are (0.1-1.0)

Be very specific about the domain. If they mention "plants", focus only on plant-related apps.
