We’ll consider the closure, and show ETAs for the nearest alternative station (if it’s within ~500 yards)\n- Same goes for accessible stations: if you’ve prioritized step-free trips in the settings, we’ll prioritize ETAs for stations marked as “accessible” (if they’re within ~500 yards)\n- We’ve also added logic to remove redundant ETAs for loop routes (aka routes that go in a loop-de-doop, and make multiple stops in the same small area, but while travelling in different directions)\n- And if you’ve got room for leftovers? No you don’t: we removed a bunch of leftover bugs from this summer’s Transit 6.0 launch. Bug bye!\n\nSpot any new bugs? Let us know before the food coma kicks in.\n\nRate us 5 stars to set the turkeys free.",

Best of all, it’s completely free to use!\n\nWe're a new kind of rideshare app. We started up from scratch in 2013, and since then we've grown like crazy all around the world.\nAnd now we're bringing our game-changing rides to the USA!\n\nIt’s an excellent taxi alternative for your trip. You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. \n\nMORE CONTROL\nSet the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you\n\nFAIR PRICES\nOur rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees\n\nSAFETY FIRST\nVetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team\n\nAs a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take.\n\nWhy Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app)\n\nLOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS\n\nWe keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch.\nWe think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. \n\nQUICK AND EASY\n\nRequesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started.\n\nOFFER YOUR PRICE\n\nWe understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. \n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\n\nWith inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps.\n\nSTAY SAFE\n\nBefore accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers.\n\nADD EXTRA OPTIONS\n\nBy using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request.\n\nJOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\n\nIf you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative.\n\nWhether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative.

We've also added a touch of the new Liquid Glass design for everyone using iOS 26.\n\nAlso, bug fixes! We've fixed an issue where widgets wouldn't display correctly on devices with Clear or Tinted home screens, as well as a bug where the line search bar would appear when you tapped on a stop on a route map, obscuring the back button.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re enjoying the app, a quick rating or review really helps us out. Got feedback or ideas? We’re always listening — just drop us a message from the Help section in the app. Thanks for riding with us!",

All Kango drivers have at least 3 years of childcare experience, and have passed our comprehensive screening process (including fingerprinting, background checks and DMV checks) and training to ensure they can provide the best, safest service possible. You can even request your family's preferred drivers, or meet a driver in advance.\n\nKango serves CA - SF Bay Area, LA, San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley, Modesto/Stockton/Merced, Oroville, Monterey, Salinas, Orange County, and San Diego and Arizona - Phoenix, Tucson, Casa Grande.\n\n*****************************************\nHOW KANGO WORKS\n\nKango gives you access to a trustworthy selection of pre-screened drivers.

Prices vary according to the type and duration of services required.\n\n*****************************************\nPRAISE FOR KANGO\n\nFROM PARENTS:\n“I chose to use Kango because it is the most convenient way to get around with a toddler. The drivers are screened and they have their own car seats which saves a lot of hassle.”\n~Blanca\n\n\"I work full time so I thought I'd have to skip opportunities for my kids that are off site from school/after-school care...so finding out about Kango was great! My son, who is often tentative with new people and processes, is completely comfortable and enjoys the rides (and story times!) with the driver.\"\n~Leah G.\n\nFROM KANGO DRIVERS:\n\"I love being a part of the Kango family, especially driving the little ones ...I can interact directly with parents in the app and schedule my rides ahead of time. It's an app with a human touch.\"\n~Stassa\n\n“Having two teenage kids of my own, I drove my kids to school myself for years...I do this for Kango now and it puts a smile on my face. I'm grateful to be able to continue this very important work.”\n~Lola\n\n\nFROM THE PRESS:\n\"They say it takes a village to raise a child, but an app called Kango is bringing that idiom into the 21st century [… ] Kango is going to make parents' lives much easier.\"\n--Business Insider\n\n\"Parents will like this app, but kids who used to get stuck waiting for a ride home will love it.\" --Techcrunch",

When you’re ready to book a Kango driver, sign up and request what you need. Prices vary according to the type and duration of services required.\n\n*****************************************\nPRAISE FOR KANGO\n\nFROM PARENTS:\n“I chose to use Kango because it is the most convenient way to get around with a toddler. The drivers are screened and they have their own car seats which saves a lot of hassle.”\n~Blanca\n\n\"I work full time so I thought I'd have to skip opportunities for my kids that are off site from school/after-school care...so finding out about Kango was great! My son, who is often tentative with new people and processes, is completely comfortable and enjoys the rides (and story times!) with the driver.\"\n~Leah G.\n\nFROM KANGO DRIVERS:\n\"I love being a part of the Kango family, especially driving the little ones ...I can interact directly with parents in the app and schedule my rides ahead of time. It's an app with a human touch.\"\n~Stassa\n\n“Having two teenage kids of my own, I drove my kids to school myself for years...I do this for Kango now and it puts a smile on my face. I'm grateful to be able to continue this very important work.”\n~Lola\n\n\nFROM THE PRESS:\n\"They say it takes a village to raise a child, but an app called Kango is bringing that idiom into the 21st century [… ] Kango is going to make parents' lives much easier.\"\n--Business Insider\n\n\"Parents will like this app, but kids who used to get stuck waiting for a ride home will love it.\" --Techcrunch",

      "description": "SporTran OnDemand\n\nWith input from the community, we’ve created a public transit alternative – SporTran OnDemand! OnDemand offers a direct route from designated OnDemand stop to OnDemand stop for riders in one of the OnDemand locations/zones. Arrive in style in one of our Dodge Caravans or Chevy Malibu and Dodge Challenger sedans. OnDemand has replaced our former LiftLine service, providing direct transport for those in need of Paratransit (ADA) accessibility. Our OnDemand paratransit vans are specially equipped with wheelchair lifts/ramps and other accessibility features that allow maximum mobility for customers with disabilities.\n\n\n\nHow is OnDemand different than fixed-route bus service?\n\n· OnDemand provides faster service for the OnDemand locations listed below, bypassing the stops and hubs riders don’t need. \n\n\n\n· OnDemand is being rolled out in phases. We will update the list as we bring new zones into the OnDemand service area.\n\n\n\n· OnDemand is an opportunity to build rural connectivity. For citizens in outlying areas without access to a standard bus line, OnDemand can get you to one of our hubs, and then connect you to a variety of locations.\n\n\n\n·  The best part? OnDemand fares are FREE!\n\n\n\nSporTran traces its history to the 1870's when mule drawn street cars ran from the downtown area to nearby outlying areas. Today, SporTran sports a fleet of over 95 modern heavy duty and smaller cutaway buses equipped to handle all passengers, including those with disabilities. Our buses are powered by the latest emission reduction systems such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and 100% Battery Electric Technology.\n\nBeginning in 2022, all SporTran and SporTran OnDemand rides are Zero Fare! Passengers pay nothing for their trips.",

        "description": "SporTran OnDemand\n\nWith input from the community, we’ve created a public transit alternative – SporTran OnDemand! OnDemand offers a direct route from designated OnDemand stop to OnDemand stop for riders in one of the OnDemand locations/zones. Arrive in style in one of our Dodge Caravans or Chevy Malibu and Dodge Challenger sedans. OnDemand has replaced our former LiftLine service, providing direct transport for those in need of Paratransit (ADA) accessibility. Our OnDemand paratransit vans are specially equipped with wheelchair lifts/ramps and other accessibility features that allow maximum mobility for customers with disabilities.\n\n\n\nHow is OnDemand different than fixed-route bus service?\n\n· OnDemand provides faster service for the OnDemand locations listed below, bypassing the stops and hubs riders don’t need. \n\n\n\n· OnDemand is being rolled out in phases. We will update the list as we bring new zones into the OnDemand service area.\n\n\n\n· OnDemand is an opportunity to build rural connectivity. For citizens in outlying areas without access to a standard bus line, OnDemand can get you to one of our hubs, and then connect you to a variety of locations.\n\n\n\n·  The best part? OnDemand fares are FREE!\n\n\n\nSporTran traces its history to the 1870's when mule drawn street cars ran from the downtown area to nearby outlying areas. Today, SporTran sports a fleet of over 95 modern heavy duty and smaller cutaway buses equipped to handle all passengers, including those with disabilities. Our buses are powered by the latest emission reduction systems such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and 100% Battery Electric Technology.\n\nBeginning in 2022, all SporTran and SporTran OnDemand rides are Zero Fare! Passengers pay nothing for their trips.",

      "description": "Pierce Transit On-Demand makes it easier than ever to ride transit in Pierce County — with one simple smartphone app and just a few taps, book a ride within our Runner zones wherever the bus can’t take you. To provide the fastest service, we may pair you with others headed in a similar direction.\n \nHOW IT WORKS:\n- Download the app and create an account.\n- Get picked up and dropped off where you want.\n- Share your ride with others.\n- Save cash and time.\n \n \nWhat we’re about:\n\nCONVENIENT\nUse your phone to tell Pierce Transit Runner where you are and where you want to go. We’ll take you there. To provide faster service, you’ll be paired with others heading in a similar direction.\n\nFAST\nIt just takes a minute to book your ride! The app will send you an approximate arrival time for your Pierce Transit Runner vehicle.\n\nAFFORDABLE\nPierce Transit Runner costs the same as a bus trip, and daily and 30-day passes are accepted. Pay your fare using ORCA, Transit app on your smartphone, or a paper pass. To pay using cash, visit one of the many ORCA retail locations or vending machines to convert your cash to E-Purse value. For more information on buying or using an ORCA card, visit myorca.com.\n \n\nSUSTAINABLE.\nSharing rides reduces the number of vehicles on the roads, bringing down congestion and CO2 emissions. You can even double up your green cred by connecting with other public transit services. With a couple of taps, you get to do your part to make your city a little bit greener and cleaner, every time you ride.\n \n\nQuestions? Reach out to support-pierce@ridewithvia.com\nLoving your experience so far? Give us a 5-star rating. You’ll have our eternal gratitude.",

      "description": "Salem Skipper makes it easier than ever to move around the city of Salem, MA — with a few taps, book a ride using the app and we’ll pair you with others headed your way. No detours, no delays.\n\nWhat we’re about:\nSHARED.\nOur tech matches people headed in the same direction. This means you’re getting the convenience and comfort of a private ride with the efficiency, speed, and affordability of a public one.\n\nSUSTAINABLE.\nSharing rides reduces the number of vehicles on the roads, bringing down congestion and CO2 emissions. With a couple of taps, you get to do your part to make your city a little bit greener and cleaner, every time you ride.\n\nAFFORDABLE\nRides are priced comparable to public transport and there are additional discounts for passengers who qualify. Head to salemskipper.com for more information. \n\nHow does Salem Skipper work?\n- Salem Skipper is an on-demand travel concept that takes multiple passengers heading in the same direction and books them into a shared vehicle. Using the Salem Skipper app, input your address and we’ll match you with a vehicle going your way. We’ll pick you up on a nearby corner and drop you off within a short walk of your chosen destination. Now for the clever bit; our algorithms provide journey times that are comparable to a taxi and much more convenient than other modes of travel, making public transportation easier than ever before! \n\n How long will I wait\n- You'll always get an accurate estimate of your pick-up ETA before booking. - You can also track your bus in real time using the app.\n\nQuestions? Head to salemskipper.com or reach out at support-\nsalem@ridewithvia.com.\nLoving your experience so far? Give us a 5-star rating.",

        "description": "Salem Skipper makes it easier than ever to move around the city of Salem, MA — with a few taps, book a ride using the app and we’ll pair you with others headed your way. No detours, no delays.\n\nWhat we’re about:\nSHARED.\nOur tech matches people headed in the same direction. This means you’re getting the convenience and comfort of a private ride with the efficiency, speed, and affordability of a public one.\n\nSUSTAINABLE.\nSharing rides reduces the number of vehicles on the roads, bringing down congestion and CO2 emissions. With a couple of taps, you get to do your part to make your city a little bit greener and cleaner, every time you ride.\n\nAFFORDABLE\nRides are priced comparable to public transport and there are additional discounts for passengers who qualify. Head to salemskipper.com for more information. \n\nHow does Salem Skipper work?\n- Salem Skipper is an on-demand travel concept that takes multiple passengers heading in the same direction and books them into a shared vehicle. Using the Salem Skipper app, input your address and we’ll match you with a vehicle going your way. We’ll pick you up on a nearby corner and drop you off within a short walk of your chosen destination. Now for the clever bit; our algorithms provide journey times that are comparable to a taxi and much more convenient than other modes of travel, making public transportation easier than ever before! \n\n How long will I wait\n- You'll always get an accurate estimate of your pick-up ETA before booking. - You can also track your bus in real time using the app.\n\nQuestions? Head to salemskipper.com or reach out at support-\nsalem@ridewithvia.com.\nLoving your experience so far? Give us a 5-star rating.",

      "description": "Palo Alto Link is the city’s easy, affordable, and eco-friendly service. We are a rideshare service that comes when you want, where you want — give us your pickup and dropoff addresses, and we’ll provide a few ride options. Choose the ride option that works best for you and get directions to a nearby intersection where a driver will pick you up.\n \nHow it works:\n- Book a ride on your phone.\n- Get picked up on a nearby corner.\n- Share your ride with others \n\nWhat we’re about:\n\nSHARED.\nOur corner-to-corner algorithm matches people headed in the same direction. Aggregating people into one vehicle brings down prices and lowers CO2 emissions. Enough said. \n\nSUSTAINABLE.\nSharing rides reduces the number of vehicles on the roads, bringing down congestion and CO2 emissions. On top of this,  our vehicle fleet is a mix of hybrid and fully electric vehicles. With a couple of taps, you get to do your part to make your city a little bit greener and cleaner, every time you ride. \n\nQuestions? Reach out at support-pal@ridewithvia.com.

No detours, no delays.\n \nWhat we’re about:\nSHARED.\nOur tech matches people headed in the same direction. This means you’re getting the convenience and comfort of a private ride with the efficiency, speed, and affordability of a public one.\n \nSUSTAINABLE.\nSharing rides reduces the number of vehicles on the roads, bringing down congestion and CO2 emissions. With a couple of taps, you get to do your part to make your city a little bit greener and cleaner, every time you ride.\n \nAFFORDABLE\nRides are priced comparable to public transport and you can add people to your bookings for even less. Head to valdostaondemand.com for more information.\n\n\nHow does Valdosta On-Demand work?\n- Valdosta On-Demand is an on-demand travel concept that takes multiple passengers heading in the same direction and books them into a shared vehicle. Using the Valdosta On-Demand app, input your address and we’ll match you with a vehicle going your way. We’ll pick you up on a nearby corner and drop you off within a short walk of your chosen destination. Now for the clever bit; our algorithms provide journey times that are comparable to a taxi and much more convenient than other modes of travel, making public transportation easier than ever before! \n\nHow long will I wait\n- You'll always get an accurate estimate of your pick-up ETA before booking.\n- You can also track your bus in real time using the app.\n \nQuestions? Head to valdostaondemand.com or reach out at support-valdosta@ridewithvia.com.\nLoving your experience so far? Give us a 5-star rating.",

Now for the clever bit; our algorithms provide journey times that are comparable to a taxi and much more convenient than other modes of travel, making on-demand transportation easier than ever before!\n\nWhat we’re about:\nSHARED.\nOur tech matches people headed in the same direction. This means you’re getting the convenience and comfort of a private ride with the efficiency, speed, and affordability of a public one.\n\nSUSTAINABLE.\nSharing rides reduces the number of vehicles on the roads, bringing down congestion and CO2 emissions. With a couple of taps, you get to do your part to make your city a little bit greener and cleaner, every time you ride.\n\nAFFORDABLE.\nRides are priced comparable to public transport and you can add people to your bookings for even less.\n\n\nQuestions?

      "description": "Affordable, Accessible Transit Service, Your Way!\n\nMETRO Connect is Rock Region METRO’s on-demand microtransit service.\n\n\nWHY MICROTRANSIT?\nFor certain service areas, including areas of emerging or low transit demand, microtransit does a better job of meeting transit demand than a full-size bus operating on a fixed route. Microtransit allows Rock Region METRO to provide on-demand, shared transit rides using smaller vehicles within a set zone, during regular operating hours, via its METRO Connect on-demand service.\n\nBENEFITS TO RIDERS\nMETRO Connect offers:\n• POINT-TO-POINT SERVICE: METRO Connect on-demand microtransit service takes riders from a point within the zone to any other point within the zone.\n• AFFORDABLE FARES: A METRO Connect trip is more affordable than trips using traditional Transportation Network Companies, as METRO Connect is part of the Rock Region METRO publicly funded public transit service.\n• NEW PLACES: METRO Connect access central Arkansas destinations that have not previously been served by non-paratransit public transit service.\n\nHOW TO USE METRO CONNECT MICROTRANSIT SERVICE\nDownload the METRO Connect app to schedule ride-hailing trips occurring within a set microtransit zone, during regular METRO Connect zone operating hours (hours vary per zone). Each zone allows riders to travel from point-to-point within the zone to access destinations, including additional METRO transit service, such as fixed bus routes. Find METRO Connect microtransit zone maps, zone hours of operations and connecting fixed routes at rrmetro.org. Standard METRO fares apply.",

        "description": "Affordable, Accessible Transit Service, Your Way!\n\nMETRO Connect is Rock Region METRO’s on-demand microtransit service.\n\n\nWHY MICROTRANSIT?\nFor certain service areas, including areas of emerging or low transit demand, microtransit does a better job of meeting transit demand than a full-size bus operating on a fixed route. Microtransit allows Rock Region METRO to provide on-demand, shared transit rides using smaller vehicles within a set zone, during regular operating hours, via its METRO Connect on-demand service.\n\nBENEFITS TO RIDERS\nMETRO Connect offers:\n• POINT-TO-POINT SERVICE: METRO Connect on-demand microtransit service takes riders from a point within the zone to any other point within the zone.\n• AFFORDABLE FARES: A METRO Connect trip is more affordable than trips using traditional Transportation Network Companies, as METRO Connect is part of the Rock Region METRO publicly funded public transit service.\n• NEW PLACES: METRO Connect access central Arkansas destinations that have not previously been served by non-paratransit public transit service.\n\nHOW TO USE METRO CONNECT MICROTRANSIT SERVICE\nDownload the METRO Connect app to schedule ride-hailing trips occurring within a set microtransit zone, during regular METRO Connect zone operating hours (hours vary per zone). Each zone allows riders to travel from point-to-point within the zone to access destinations, including additional METRO transit service, such as fixed bus routes. Find METRO Connect microtransit zone maps, zone hours of operations and connecting fixed routes at rrmetro.org. Standard METRO fares apply.",

This information includes the location of places visited by participants along with details that explain the why, how, and when of travel to these places.\n \nTransportation planners will use information collected from this study to develop forecasts of future travel in your city, region, and state. A number of households have been randomly selected to participate and represent households in the entire region. Only selected households have been provided a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and are able to use the DailyTravel app. The information that your household and other households in the survey provide will help build a complete and accurate picture of state and local transportation needs so that public funds for improvements can be spent where they are needed most.\n \nPlease visit the DailyTravel support website for more information. \n\nWarning: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",

        "description": "DailyTravel is an app designed by Westat to collect travel information for transportation studies. This information includes the location of places visited by participants along with details that explain the why, how, and when of travel to these places.\n \nTransportation planners will use information collected from this study to develop forecasts of future travel in your city, region, and state. A number of households have been randomly selected to participate and represent households in the entire region. Only selected households have been provided a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and are able to use the DailyTravel app. The information that your household and other households in the survey provide will help build a complete and accurate picture of state and local transportation needs so that public funds for improvements can be spent where they are needed most.\n \nPlease visit the DailyTravel support website for more information. \n\nWarning: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",

      "description": "Welcome to the BRATS On-Demand mobile rider app – the official app for riders of BRATS public transit services in Baldwin County. Let us help connect you to the people and places that matter most to you.\n\nCurrently, this app is for use to ride our on-demand and pre-booked, origin-to-destination weekday transit service. Stay tuned! We’re working to expand the app to cover other services we provide.\n\nWho We Are\n\nBaldwin Regional Area Transit System (BRATS) provides specialized public transportation services across all of Baldwin County. Due to the county’s geographic size, service may be limited to certain days and times in some areas of the County. BRATS is operated by the Baldwin County Commission. BRATS is funded and supported by funding from the Federal Transit Administration and the Baldwin County Commission, with oversight from the Alabama Department of Transportation.\n\nAreas We Serve\n\nCurrently, you can use the app to request a shared transit ride Monday through Friday between 7:30 AM and 5 PM, depending on your location within the County. \nTrips within the most of the Eastern Shore area are available on-demand. Trips within the Foley area are available on-demand.. Trips within the Robertsdale area are available on-demand. Trips within the Bay Minette area are available on-demand. \nTrips between those areas are available Monday through Friday, but require pre-scheduling. The availability of trips from areas outside the locations above vary based on the day of the week. For more information or to provide feedback, please visit www.ridebrats.com or email us at bratsbooking@baldwincountyal.gov.\n\nHow Can I Request A Ride?\n\nYou can get a ride in three easy steps. First, download the BRATS On-Demand App. Second, create an account. Third, request a ride (anywhere in the service area)! \nYou can also call 251-972-6817 and book a ride over the phone.\n\nWho Can Ride?\n\nThat’s the beauty of it. Anyone can ride! However, keep in mind that BRATS drivers are not caretakers and can not act as a Personal Care Attendant. \n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nBRATS On-Demand is a convenient on-demand transit service that takes multiple people heading in the same direction and transports them in a shared van or bus (i.e. a shared ride). Using the app, enter the address where you are at and your desired destination. Tell us approximately what time you would like to depart for your trip, or let us know if there is a specific time you need to be somewhere.  We then match you with a vehicle going your way, give you an estimated trip duration, and then ask if you want to book the trip. Click “Book Trip” and we’ll take you to your destination.\n\nBRATS On-Demand is convenient! When you book a trip, we will come to your location (we may ask you to walk a short distance). We will drop you off at a curb near your destination or even closer if necessary. No need to walk to a predetermined stop or wait out in the heat or cold. How awesome is that?\n\nWant to schedule in advance? Great news! You can book a ride up to a week  in advance.\n\nHow Long Will I Wait?\n\nThat depends on what details you gave us when you booked your trip and how busy we are. You’ll get an accurate estimate of your wait time before you book your trip.  The closer we get to your assigned pick-up time we’ll send you periodic updates so you know when we have arrived.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n\nBRATS charges a low mileage fare. You will be notified of your fare before you book your trip. Please visit www.ridebrats.com for details. \n\nSupport\n\nPlease e-mail us at bratsbooking@baldwincountyal.gov or call us at (251) 972-6817 with any issues or questions.\n\nLove our app? Please rate us!",

        "description": "Welcome to the BRATS On-Demand mobile rider app – the official app for riders of BRATS public transit services in Baldwin County. Let us help connect you to the people and places that matter most to you.\n\nCurrently, this app is for use to ride our on-demand and pre-booked, origin-to-destination weekday transit service. Stay tuned! We’re working to expand the app to cover other services we provide.\n\nWho We Are\n\nBaldwin Regional Area Transit System (BRATS) provides specialized public transportation services across all of Baldwin County. Due to the county’s geographic size, service may be limited to certain days and times in some areas of the County. BRATS is operated by the Baldwin County Commission. BRATS is funded and supported by funding from the Federal Transit Administration and the Baldwin County Commission, with oversight from the Alabama Department of Transportation.\n\nAreas We Serve\n\nCurrently, you can use the app to request a shared transit ride Monday through Friday between 7:30 AM and 5 PM, depending on your location within the County. \nTrips within the most of the Eastern Shore area are available on-demand. Trips within the Foley area are available on-demand.. Trips within the Robertsdale area are available on-demand. Trips within the Bay Minette area are available on-demand. \nTrips between those areas are available Monday through Friday, but require pre-scheduling. The availability of trips from areas outside the locations above vary based on the day of the week. For more information or to provide feedback, please visit www.ridebrats.com or email us at bratsbooking@baldwincountyal.gov.\n\nHow Can I Request A Ride?\n\nYou can get a ride in three easy steps. First, download the BRATS On-Demand App. Second, create an account. Third, request a ride (anywhere in the service area)! \nYou can also call 251-972-6817 and book a ride over the phone.\n\nWho Can Ride?\n\nThat’s the beauty of it. Anyone can ride! However, keep in mind that BRATS drivers are not caretakers and can not act as a Personal Care Attendant. \n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nBRATS On-Demand is a convenient on-demand transit service that takes multiple people heading in the same direction and transports them in a shared van or bus (i.e. a shared ride). Using the app, enter the address where you are at and your desired destination. Tell us approximately what time you would like to depart for your trip, or let us know if there is a specific time you need to be somewhere.  We then match you with a vehicle going your way, give you an estimated trip duration, and then ask if you want to book the trip. Click “Book Trip” and we’ll take you to your destination.\n\nBRATS On-Demand is convenient! When you book a trip, we will come to your location (we may ask you to walk a short distance). We will drop you off at a curb near your destination or even closer if necessary. No need to walk to a predetermined stop or wait out in the heat or cold. How awesome is that?\n\nWant to schedule in advance? Great news! You can book a ride up to a week  in advance.\n\nHow Long Will I Wait?\n\nThat depends on what details you gave us when you booked your trip and how busy we are. You’ll get an accurate estimate of your wait time before you book your trip.  The closer we get to your assigned pick-up time we’ll send you periodic updates so you know when we have arrived.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n\nBRATS charges a low mileage fare. You will be notified of your fare before you book your trip. Please visit www.ridebrats.com for details. \n\nSupport\n\nPlease e-mail us at bratsbooking@baldwincountyal.gov or call us at (251) 972-6817 with any issues or questions.\n\nLove our app? Please rate us!",

      "description": "The CharmPass app lets you purchase and use fares instantly on your phone—anywhere, anytime.

CHOOSE SERVICE \n2. CHOOSE FARE\n3. SELECT TICKET TYPE\n4. CHOOSE QUANTITY\n5. CHECK OUT\n \nCOMMON QUESTIONS:\nQ: Do I need to be connected to the Internet?\nA: Cellular network or a wireless Internet connection is required to purchase tickets, but you can activate your pre-purchased tickets offline.\n\nQ: What if my battery dies?\nA: Just like with paper tickets, you're responsible for making sure you have a valid fare at all times, so be sure to plan ahead!\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS:\n• Don't uninstall the CharmPass app or erase your phone while you have active tickets on it. Your tickets are stored on your phone (which makes it possible to use them without a cellular network or a wireless Internet connection), so uninstalling the app can permanently erase your tickets!\n• Purchase your ticket anytime and activate your fare as you’re boarding.\n• Show your ticket to the operator of the vehicle.\n• Watch your battery level! Just like with paper tickets, you're responsible for making sure you have a valid fare at all times.",

There is a maximum limit of three persons per pick-up location.\nSafeRides Connect does not duplicate fixed-route service already provided by MTD. SafeRides Connect does not provide emergency transportation services to medical facilities. SafeRides Connect does not provide service to and from bars.\n\nWest Connect is a van service that operates within a designated service boundary (shown) not served by fixed routes. West Connect provides curb-to-curb service that connects outlying areas to fixed route service. If your trip is within the West Connect boundaries or at the Round Barn Road or Stephens Family YMCA transfer locations, just enter the trip information into the app and get the details of your trip.\n\nFor any questions about SafeRides, the West Connect, or MTD’s fixed-route service, please call 217.384.8188 or visit mtd.org.",
