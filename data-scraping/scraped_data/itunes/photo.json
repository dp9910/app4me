This update introduces two powerful ways to edit your photos:\n\n◆ One touch masking: Editing specific objects and regions in your photo got faster and more precise. Just tap on an object to instantly create a mask, then use the brush to fine-tune the area. All your adjustments will apply only where you want them.\n\n◆ The new Color tool: Take full control of the colors in your image. Select a color—like the blue of the sky—and adjust its hue, saturation, and luminance to get the exact look you want.\n\nenjoy the new, more precise way to edit,\nteam snapseed",

We’re not above it.\n\nFilter Collections For Every Vibe Shift \nVintage film energy? Got it. Summer in Capri? Say less. Clean girl minimalism? Obviously.  Your aesthetic is allowed to evolve.
