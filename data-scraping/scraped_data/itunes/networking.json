I had a lost pet and it immediately was met with concern and suggestions and support. Besides that it’s just a positive thing for communication and interaction. I’m so glad I downloaded the Nextdoor app!!!!” - App review\n\n“Fantastic platform for meeting neighbors, finding out local news or finding recommendations for local businesses! The ability to interact with the neighbors and being involved in the community is priceless! Highly recommend!” - App review\n\n“I really enjoy using the Nextdoor app because it helps me stay in the know and know what’s going on in my area. Also it’s a great way to help others locally” - App review\n \n“Before Nextdoor, I didn’t know there were several qualified babysitters living nearby and looking for work. It was easy to feel comfortable hiring my neighbor’s daughter to watch my son after school.” - App review\n\n“This year for Spring Cleaning, we wanted to sell old appliances, tools, clothing and electronics on Nextdoor. In no time, our neighbors stopped by to make a deal and take things off our hands. It was easier than anything else, and it feels good knowing our old stuff has found a new home in the neighborhood.” - App review\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nTo make every neighborhood feel like home.\n\nOur mission is to make every neighborhood feel like home. We do this by connecting neighbors to the local gems around them – people, places, and information.

      "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nWhen it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.\n\nPRESS\n\"It's the go-to dating app for many people looking for love.\" - The Daily Mail\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only.",

        "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nWhen it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.\n\nPRESS\n\"It's the go-to dating app for many people looking for love.\" - The Daily Mail\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only.",

      "description": "Introducing the \"Business Network App\" – a dedicated tool designed for BNI Members and Leadership Teams (LT), aiming to revolutionize the way you manage your chapters. This innovative mobile platform is geared towards enhancing productivity, simplifying management tasks, and promoting increased visibility within the BNI community. The app is optimized to keep you connected, organized, and updated – all in real-time.\n\nThe Business Network App shines as a beacon of efficiency, dramatically reducing the need for manual operations involved in chapter management. It is the ideal solution for LT members looking to streamline their administrative tasks and focus more on building stronger connections within their chapters. The BNI App brings a transformative approach to managing weekly meetings by automating the attendance logs.\n\nSay goodbye to the cumbersome, traditional attendance system. With our app, BNI Members can automatically record their attendance at weekly meetings. The intelligent system marks attendance as present, absent, late, or substitute, saving these logs for future reference. This automation not only saves precious time but also aids in improving attendance discipline among members. Members can review their attendance log at any time, helping them plan their schedules in advance and ensuring maximum visibility within their chapters. This is the efficiency that a BNI Mobile App brings to the table!\n\nCommunication within the chapter is made seamless with this app. Members can effortlessly reach out to the LT team and Co-ordinator team with a simple tap. With the integrated connectivity options, you can connect through WhatsApp or a phone call, ensuring that support is just a tap away.\n\nThe BNI App also functions as a comprehensive member directory. Keep track of your fellow members, effortlessly find and connect with them, and update your contact information as and when needed. This feature serves as a digital Rolodex, keeping the BNI community closer than ever.\n\nPersonalization is another hallmark of the Business Network App. Members can update their personal details, allowing them to highlight the services or businesses they provide. This feature ensures your profile is always up-to-date, complete with your contact information, bio, and other relevant details. This promotes transparency and helps foster stronger bonds within the BNI community.\n\nThe BNI Mobile App also revolutionizes the way members manage their product and service details. Members can autonomously update their weekly presentations, eliminating the dependence on the slide coordinator or meeting host. Upload up to 5 images and manage your weekly presentation screen with ease. The app also allows you to add specific asks to include in the presentation screen, ensuring every presentation is tailored to your needs.\n\nIn essence, the Business Network App is designed to foster a connected BNI community. With features like the member directory, personal details, and leadership team, it becomes effortless to find and connect with other members. The BNI App is not just about management, it's about growth, networking, and community. Experience the future of BNI today!\n\n \n\nDisclaimer: The Business Network App is not an official BNI Mobile App. It is an independently developed platform designed to aid BNI Chapter's Leadership Teams in managing their chapters more effectively and efficiently. This app functions as a comprehensive tool for enhancing productivity, connectivity, and transparency within the BNI community. However, it should not be confused with an official application from BNI. All BNI-related terminologies and references are used under the context of this app's functionality and its intended use for BNI Members and Leadership Teams.",

      "description": "Networkr is based on the idea that “Growing Your Network Grows Your Business.” If people want to do business with people they know and trust, Networkr will help you do that!\n\nNetworkr is a business relationship building platform designed to help you grow new local relationships by making sure you are always meeting new people at various networking events, through introductions, and groups found in the app. Networkr takes into account a lot of factors, such as using industry and demographics information to help you meet more people. \n\nNetworkr uses a level scale from 0-4 to tell how well you know someone and to help you grow your relationships. The levels are:\n0 - Peer (Someone you haven't met)\n1 - Someone you Met\n2 - Someone you Know\n3 - Someone you Know & Trust\n4 - Raving Fan and Friend\n\nWhen you attend an event or check-in to a location using our map, Networkr connects you to everyone at the event will become a Level 0, and those at your table will become a Level 1. The app will help you take your level 1 relationships to level 2 by finding recommended times to meet with those you have recently met. When new relationships become level 2 (Know & Trust), you will start to see your business grow.\n\nYou can keep in touch with everyone you meet via the social features of our app.\n\nIf you’d like more visitors going to your Networking event. Explore what Networkr can bring to enhance your opportunities.\n\nFor Networking Groups: \n\nRSVP Tool. Networkr makes it easier and more effective for your members and guests to RSVP for upcoming events.Invites can be sent to your networking event via email and our app. \n\nMeeting new people. Using the proprietary seating algorithm feature, Networkr gives your attendees the opportunity to grow their network each time they attend an event.\n\nTracking. Keep track of guests and members so you can follow up with them (especially the guests). \n\nCreate events. You can create public events, or you can create private events that are for a segment of your members (e.g. a board of directors group or a segment that’s interested in certain training).\n\nSocial interactions to help your attendees keep in touch with each other.\n\nNetworkr gives your networking organization and your members the ability to grow faster than ever before.\n\nWe are looking forward to Networking with you soon!\n\nA  purchase will be applied to your iTunes account.

        "description": "Networkr is based on the idea that “Growing Your Network Grows Your Business.” If people want to do business with people they know and trust, Networkr will help you do that!\n\nNetworkr is a business relationship building platform designed to help you grow new local relationships by making sure you are always meeting new people at various networking events, through introductions, and groups found in the app. Networkr takes into account a lot of factors, such as using industry and demographics information to help you meet more people. \n\nNetworkr uses a level scale from 0-4 to tell how well you know someone and to help you grow your relationships. The levels are:\n0 - Peer (Someone you haven't met)\n1 - Someone you Met\n2 - Someone you Know\n3 - Someone you Know & Trust\n4 - Raving Fan and Friend\n\nWhen you attend an event or check-in to a location using our map, Networkr connects you to everyone at the event will become a Level 0, and those at your table will become a Level 1. The app will help you take your level 1 relationships to level 2 by finding recommended times to meet with those you have recently met. When new relationships become level 2 (Know & Trust), you will start to see your business grow.\n\nYou can keep in touch with everyone you meet via the social features of our app.\n\nIf you’d like more visitors going to your Networking event. Explore what Networkr can bring to enhance your opportunities.\n\nFor Networking Groups: \n\nRSVP Tool. Networkr makes it easier and more effective for your members and guests to RSVP for upcoming events.Invites can be sent to your networking event via email and our app. \n\nMeeting new people. Using the proprietary seating algorithm feature, Networkr gives your attendees the opportunity to grow their network each time they attend an event.\n\nTracking. Keep track of guests and members so you can follow up with them (especially the guests). \n\nCreate events. You can create public events, or you can create private events that are for a segment of your members (e.g. a board of directors group or a segment that’s interested in certain training).\n\nSocial interactions to help your attendees keep in touch with each other.\n\nNetworkr gives your networking organization and your members the ability to grow faster than ever before.\n\nWe are looking forward to Networking with you soon!\n\nA  purchase will be applied to your iTunes account.

      "description": "Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.\n\nReddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.\n\nRedditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:\n• r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n• r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n• r/science, for scientific discussions and news\n• r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you’ll find:\n• Thousands of community groups\nBreaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n• Loads of laughs\nFind memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n\n• AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n• The best discussions on any topic\nReddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n• Get answers to anonymous questions \nAsk communities anything you want.

Through the use of geotagging technology, Myngly takes traditional networking apps to the next level by showing users exactly where their matches are in real-time.\n \nNo more questioning where people are or wondering if you might run into someone you’d match with.\n \nMyngly removes the guess work and puts you in the room with the people you’re looking to meet.\n\nWhy you’ll love using the Myngly app: \n\nDISCOVER YOUR CONNECTIONS INSTANTLY \nFind locations with your people IRL.

Use the filters to enter your criteria and parameters, move around the map, click a pin, and see where everyone is at!\n \nDISCOVER YOUR CONNECTIONS IN THE ROOM\nWe put you in the same room as your people and provide spatial awareness, so you never miss a connection again due to timing or chance. See who is in the room with you and even who was there after you’ve left.\n \nDISCOVER YOUR CONNECTIONS IN THE FUTURE\nFind and identify current and future get-togethers with your matches. RSVP, connect, chat and start learning more before about your connections before the in-person meeting.\n \nHOST AN EVENT\nBusinesses and organizations can host and promote events to Myngly users.\n \nSAFE CONNECTIONS\nMynglers must have a mutual match to connect and message. Privacy features ensure the safety and privacy of our members\n \nHow does it work?\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR PROFILE\n-      Create your account with your status (entrepreneur, business owner, executive, freelancer, student, etc.), place of work and professional goals\n-      Select the fields you’re most interested in (investment, communication, marketing, sales, finance, engineering, etc.)\n\nGPS FOR YOUR SOCIAL LIFE\n-      Myngly’s filters help you narrow down your options and pinpoint only those of interest\n-      When you are at a public location with other Mynlgy users, your profiles appear on the map. Users are NEVER individually tracked\n \nCONNECT\n-      Have a look at your potential matches and for each profile, you have 2 options: yes or no\n-      When you are interested in the profile, just check yes and start talking with inspiring people\n-      Then, you can chat, discover your mutual interest and build an empowered and sustainable relationship\n \nMEET IRL\n-      Use Myngly to navigate your connections with confidence\n-      Prepare before you walk up to a mynglyer; read their profile, interests and what they are looking for\n-      Introduce yourself, shake hands and find ways to add value to them first! \n \nBy using this networking app, we can share ambitions, move and shake, and embark on new beginnings in real life. We are better together!\n\nMyngly is free to download and use.

UV Chamber Network take into account a lot of factors, such as using industry and demographic information to help you meet more people. \n\nUV Chamber Network uses a level scale from 0-4 to tell how well you know someone and to help you grow your relationships. The levels are:\n0 - Peer\n1 - Someone you met\n2 - Someone you know\n3 - Someone you know and trust\n4 - Raving Fan and Friend\n\nWhen you attend an event using UV Chamber Network everyone at the event will become a Level 0 and those at your table will become a Level 1. The app will help you take your level 1 relationships to level 2 by finding recommended times to meet with those you have recently met. When new relationships become level 2 (Know & Trust), you will start to see your business grow.\n\nA  purchase will be applied to your iTunes account.

Take advantage of the \"Who I'd Like to Meet\" feature to elevate your personal and professional network. \n\nAuthorize Introductions\nkeepwith’s double opt-in technology ensures those being introduced consent to an introduction before it is made.\n\nhttps://platform.keepwith.com/terms",

      "description": "App will find all hosts in your home network or in selected IP range. It can be used not only to know who are using your WiFi and learn more about every device, but also for solving professional tasks.\n\nBy installing ScanNet - Network Scanner on your device, you get a handy and easy-to-use network scanner that does not require special knowledge when working in the default mode.\n\nFollowing functions and capabilities of the application will be useful for administrators and IT specialists:\n1) The ability to check ports right during the search for hosts. Filtering by open ports allows you to quickly find the server you need on your network.\n2) IP scanner supports 4 scan modes - arp read, icmp ping, udp ping, dns request. The ability to manually set a DNS server significantly expands the functionality of scanning private networks.\n3) A wide range of settings allows you to manually set both the scanning mode and the used methods of name resolution - currently supported by DNS, mDNS, netbios.\n4) Advanced search in the list of found hosts - you can search both by all available information, and by address, name, open ports.\n5) Personalization - the ability to change the picture and the hostname displayed in the interface. This function requires binding to the WiFi network name for the best performance. In order for the application to get the network name, access to the location will be requested.\n6) The function of saving a list of found devices and opening it for study later.\n7) The program includes network utilities familiar to every administrator - ping, tracerout, port scanner. Premium access allows you to access them directly from the device information screen. In the free version, all utilities are available for calling from the application menu.",

It can be used not only to know who are using your WiFi and learn more about every device, but also for solving professional tasks.\n\nBy installing ScanNet - Network Scanner on your device, you get a handy and easy-to-use network scanner that does not require special knowledge when working in the default mode.\n\nFollowing functions and capabilities of the application will be useful for administrators and IT specialists:\n1) The ability to check ports right during the search for hosts. Filtering by open ports allows you to quickly find the server you need on your network.\n2) IP scanner supports 4 scan modes - arp read, icmp ping, udp ping, dns request. The ability to manually set a DNS server significantly expands the functionality of scanning private networks.\n3) A wide range of settings allows you to manually set both the scanning mode and the used methods of name resolution - currently supported by DNS, mDNS, netbios.\n4) Advanced search in the list of found hosts - you can search both by all available information, and by address, name, open ports.\n5) Personalization - the ability to change the picture and the hostname displayed in the interface. This function requires binding to the WiFi network name for the best performance. In order for the application to get the network name, access to the location will be requested.\n6) The function of saving a list of found devices and opening it for study later.\n7) The program includes network utilities familiar to every administrator - ping, tracerout, port scanner. Premium access allows you to access them directly from the device information screen. In the free version, all utilities are available for calling from the application menu.",

      "description": "For frustrated business owners who would love to meet the people they see on social channels and actually network “in-person”. Book yourself and those you wish to invite on group video calls where each person briefly outlines what they do.\n\nA simple ice-breaking structure which gets you on the radar of people who could become your next customer.\n\nIt’s a process which begins with familiarity. Gentle, light-humoured and relaxed events. Attend more frequently and even these brief “get to know each other” events can build into trust.\n\nIf you like, opt-in to the private 1-2-1 video meeting process. Chaperoned by a review system, each participant is asked to allow each other an equal amount of time to speak.\n\nAnd pushy sales techniques are also discouraged. You anonymously rate each other on adherence to these guidelines to produce your 1-2-1 rating.\n\nThat’s updated after each set of 5 meetings.\n\nWant to get known even more? Create a community special offer. You choose – perhaps a freebie sample of what you do.\n\nThis can help you get positively reviewed in-app and build your reputation.\n\nOr maybe create a time-limited discount, or offer a value-added extra only members of this community can take advantage of.\n\nBuild your own reputation with 1-2-1 reviews, client reviews and make sure you complete your profile with details of your profession and any keywords people may search for.\n\nUse our training videos to learn good online networking etiquette both within the community, and outside of it – for example when inviting guests to group meetings.\n\nIt’s not a sales-focused community. It’s about a journey of creating FAMILIARITY, building TRUST and ultimately winning SALES through good networking etiquette.",

        "description": "For frustrated business owners who would love to meet the people they see on social channels and actually network “in-person”. Book yourself and those you wish to invite on group video calls where each person briefly outlines what they do.\n\nA simple ice-breaking structure which gets you on the radar of people who could become your next customer.\n\nIt’s a process which begins with familiarity. Gentle, light-humoured and relaxed events. Attend more frequently and even these brief “get to know each other” events can build into trust.\n\nIf you like, opt-in to the private 1-2-1 video meeting process. Chaperoned by a review system, each participant is asked to allow each other an equal amount of time to speak.\n\nAnd pushy sales techniques are also discouraged. You anonymously rate each other on adherence to these guidelines to produce your 1-2-1 rating.\n\nThat’s updated after each set of 5 meetings.\n\nWant to get known even more? Create a community special offer. You choose – perhaps a freebie sample of what you do.\n\nThis can help you get positively reviewed in-app and build your reputation.\n\nOr maybe create a time-limited discount, or offer a value-added extra only members of this community can take advantage of.\n\nBuild your own reputation with 1-2-1 reviews, client reviews and make sure you complete your profile with details of your profession and any keywords people may search for.\n\nUse our training videos to learn good online networking etiquette both within the community, and outside of it – for example when inviting guests to group meetings.\n\nIt’s not a sales-focused community. It’s about a journey of creating FAMILIARITY, building TRUST and ultimately winning SALES through good networking etiquette.",

      "description": "eBits – Extreme Bricks Infrastructure Traffic Simulator\n\nDescription\n\nExtreme Bricks Infrastructure Traffic Simulator (eBits) iPhone application allows users to perform a quick validation of wireless network connectivity.  By utilizing two devices running the eBits iPhone application, users can configure the Transmit / Receive node parameters along with defining the TCP settings on the transmitter in order to establish successful bi-directional communication validation between the two nodes.  \n\n\nHow to use:\n\n-Once the application has been successfully installed on two mobile devices, configure both devices to connect to the same Wireless SSID and validate successful IP Address assignment.\n-On the node designated as the Transmitter, configure the setup parameters for the Receiver station by entering in the second node’s IP Address.\n-On the node designated as the Receiver, configure the Transmitter option to OFF.  \n-Once the communication parameters have been set, press the START button on both devices. Traffic should be sent from the Transmitter node and received on the Receiver.\n\n\nFor more information on Extreme Networks, please visit http://www.extremenetworks.com/",

        "description": "eBits – Extreme Bricks Infrastructure Traffic Simulator\n\nDescription\n\nExtreme Bricks Infrastructure Traffic Simulator (eBits) iPhone application allows users to perform a quick validation of wireless network connectivity.  By utilizing two devices running the eBits iPhone application, users can configure the Transmit / Receive node parameters along with defining the TCP settings on the transmitter in order to establish successful bi-directional communication validation between the two nodes.  \n\n\nHow to use:\n\n-Once the application has been successfully installed on two mobile devices, configure both devices to connect to the same Wireless SSID and validate successful IP Address assignment.\n-On the node designated as the Transmitter, configure the setup parameters for the Receiver station by entering in the second node’s IP Address.\n-On the node designated as the Receiver, configure the Transmitter option to OFF.  \n-Once the communication parameters have been set, press the START button on both devices. Traffic should be sent from the Transmitter node and received on the Receiver.\n\n\nFor more information on Extreme Networks, please visit http://www.extremenetworks.com/",

      "description": "Securely connect to anything on the internet with Tailscale. Built on WireGuard®, Tailscale is networking technology that enables you to make finely configurable connections, secured end-to-end according to zero trust principles, between any resources on any infrastructure. Tailscale brings identity to the network layer, so that you can control access based on user identity, not only IP address. This gives you the power to intuitively and flexibly define which users should have access to which services based on existing user identities, as well as groups, services, and subnet ranges. \n\nTailscale transforms your existing network from a legacy hub and spoke model to a modern, lightweight, and responsive mesh networking architecture that eliminates single points of failure and delivers better performance, scalability, and security for your end users, devices, and remote resources.\n\nReplace legacy VPNs, connect workloads across on-prem and cloud infrastructure providers, power Zero Trust initiatives, and make remote access secure by simplifying software-defined networking and security operations. Deploy a zero-config VPN, securely access resources on any infrastructure, unlock developer workflow networking, and modernize Enterprise networking at scale with Tailscale. \n\nTailscale is hardware-agnostic—so you can make decisions about your hardware independently from decisions about your network. Tailscale creates an overlay network, using your existing network, so you can incrementally deploy it without needing new network switches or to change your network architecture.\n\nTailscale works with 100+ technology integrations and dozens of identity providers, and is available on a wide range of operating system platforms, including Apple’s macOS, iOS, and tvOS.",

This gives you the power to intuitively and flexibly define which users should have access to which services based on existing user identities, as well as groups, services, and subnet ranges. \n\nTailscale transforms your existing network from a legacy hub and spoke model to a modern, lightweight, and responsive mesh networking architecture that eliminates single points of failure and delivers better performance, scalability, and security for your end users, devices, and remote resources.\n\nReplace legacy VPNs, connect workloads across on-prem and cloud infrastructure providers, power Zero Trust initiatives, and make remote access secure by simplifying software-defined networking and security operations. Deploy a zero-config VPN, securely access resources on any infrastructure, unlock developer workflow networking, and modernize Enterprise networking at scale with Tailscale. \n\nTailscale is hardware-agnostic—so you can make decisions about your hardware independently from decisions about your network. Tailscale creates an overlay network, using your existing network, so you can incrementally deploy it without needing new network switches or to change your network architecture.\n\nTailscale works with 100+ technology integrations and dozens of identity providers, and is available on a wide range of operating system platforms, including Apple’s macOS, iOS, and tvOS.",

        "description": "Why XY VPN?\n\nTURBO SPEEDS\n\nOur modern solution based on the fast VPN service protocol gives you VPN connection speeds that are hard to beat.\n\nIDEAL FOR PRIVACY\n\nWe don’t track and store your activity online. Therefore, we can’t give your data away – even if someone asks. And we have two independent audits to prove it!\n\nAS EASY AS 1-2-3\n\nDownload, login, and connect – that’s it! With XY VPN, one tap is enough to encrypt your whole traffic. You can also set the app to connect automatically and enjoy full peace of mind.\n\nSTAY SAFE ON PUBLIC WI-FI\n\nFound a cozy café with a Wi-Fi hotspot, but it’s unsecured? Don’t give up just yet! Use XY VPN and hide your online activities from snoopers and hackers.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF SERVERS\n\nLightning-fast VPN protocols sure help, but our vast server network is there to do the heavy lifting. With 5500+ servers in 60 countries, the perfect one is always just a tap away. Click “Quick Connect,” and you’re all set! (Note: Global proxy feature requires premium access.)\n\nENCRYPT EVERYTHING\n\nHow would you like to protect your whole home with one app? Install XY VPN on your Wi-Fi router and enjoy a private internet connection on every connected device in your home.\n\nRELIABLE SERVICE\n\nUnlike a proxy server or the Tor browser, XY VPN will not only hide your IP. It will also encrypt your traffic and maintain a stable connection with speeds that are hard to match.\n\nAutomatic Renewal\n\nThe payment will be charged to your Apple ID Account at confirmation of purchase.\nThe subscription renews automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.\nYour account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of your selected subscription.\nYou can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your App Store Account Settings.\nYou are welcome to read XY VPN Terms of Service and Privacy Policy here:\nPrivacy Policy: https://as.matrixmobile.net/static/xy-ios/privacy-policy.html\nTerms of Use: https://as.matrixmobile.net/static/xy-ios/terms-of-use.html",

      "description": "Looking for a fresh approach to expanding your professional network and generating new leads for business? Try tapping into your team, colleagues and peers to uncover leads you never knew you had access to. \n\nLet's face it, most lead generation tools are costly, complicated, and frustrating to use. Public social networks are also very, very very public - and not the most effective place for collaboration. \n\nA.B.Collab is a free, easy-to-use group collaboration tool providing a work-friendly space focused on helping you uncover new leads, contacts, and opportunities from people you may already be working with.\n\nFirst, create a public or private group to post focused lead requests fast. Private groups allow you to maintain control over who collaborates on opportunities you are working on. Keep your group public to create a powerful source of new leads.  \n\nA.B.Collab lets you focus on business, filtering out social chatter, connection requests, and everything else that gets in the way of business networking. A.B.Collab allows you to engage with people that want to help you succeed - not just connect. \n\nThe fact is, cold calling results in a 1-3% success rate, and it’s abusive to both parties. When that same connection is made with a warm intro or referral, the rate jumps to 40%. With A.B.Collab you've got nothing to lose but the deal you're working on.\n\nHow it works:\n\n- Create a free account and a brief profile and a group for your requests (or join someone else’s)\n- Invite teammates to collaborate on leads with you\n- Post a request (i.e., what are you looking for?) to your group\n- Other members review your request and connect if they can help\n- If you find success, repay the favor by helping others find leads they need\n\nDiscover a professional network focused on creating a rising tide of opportunity.\n\nKey Benefits\n\n- Work with a community of peers that actually want to help you succeed\n- Feel good about helping others access hard-to-find leads and info\n- Focus on what matters most to you and leave the social chatter behind\n- Promote a spirit of collaboration and teamwork to find new leads and opportunities\n\n\n---\n\nA.B.Collab is free to use.\n\nLegal:\n\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.abcollab.com/privacy-mobile\n• Terms of Use: https://www.abcollab.com/terms-mobile",
