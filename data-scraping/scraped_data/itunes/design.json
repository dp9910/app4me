      "description": "Have you ever dreamed about running your own renovation company?\nHouse Flipper is the best free one-man makeover crew on the market. Become an interior designer and start your very own business. Carry out orders, renovate, decorate houses, and sell them with profit afterwards! Get new skins for your tools.\n\nMain features waiting for you:\n- awesome, realistic 3D graphics\n- smooth intuitive gameplay (60 FPS gameplay)\n- different interesting tasks\n- buying, renovating and selling houses as well as interior decoration.\n- Over 500 decoration items to unlock\n\nCOMPLETE ORDERS\n\nA great adventure awaits you in the House Flipper simulator - the world of renovations! Perform interesting orders that will make you feel like a real house flipper. Meet colorful characters such as Eleonor Moore and her artistically gifted animals (whose activities will be followed by cleaning). Renovate the art connoisseur's museum, Giuseppe Clavier, and help the squat residents renovate their ruined house. House Flipper offers you various locations equipped with characteristic items.\n\nDECORATE INTERIORS\n\nBecome an interior designer and arrange interiors according to your own ideas, using available items and a wide range of paints. Most of the items available in the game have from several to over a dozen variants, which you will unlock as you progress in the game. Learn not only their purpose but also the story behind them (background). What does a cat have to do with haiku writing? Why are the Babylonian invaders buying souvenirs there? You will find answers to more strange questions in the descriptions of over 500 items available in the game. All this in realistic 3D graphics!\n\nGAIN EXPERIENCE\n\nAs you progress in House Flipper, you'll level up and improve your tools. Advance to the next levels to complete the tasks (quests) faster. Why hurt your hands when you can have gloves made of hardened smurf leather? Using unlocked items, you can arrange the interior of your office according to your own design. It can be stylish, but also ... A cat tree in the middle of the room? Why not? It's your idea after all!\n\nBUY, RENEW, DECOR, SELL\n\nYou can unlock new items, buy various, though not always beautiful houses with cash and flipcoins acquired during orders. Renovate your new house and turn it into your office, or negotiate a convenient sale price at real estate agency. It doesn't matter if you clean the Trash in M5 or polish the Crimson Corner. Each of them can become your haven on the path of developing your own career in the house flipping industry or a source of additional profit.",

        "description": "Have you ever dreamed about running your own renovation company?\nHouse Flipper is the best free one-man makeover crew on the market. Become an interior designer and start your very own business. Carry out orders, renovate, decorate houses, and sell them with profit afterwards! Get new skins for your tools.\n\nMain features waiting for you:\n- awesome, realistic 3D graphics\n- smooth intuitive gameplay (60 FPS gameplay)\n- different interesting tasks\n- buying, renovating and selling houses as well as interior decoration.\n- Over 500 decoration items to unlock\n\nCOMPLETE ORDERS\n\nA great adventure awaits you in the House Flipper simulator - the world of renovations! Perform interesting orders that will make you feel like a real house flipper. Meet colorful characters such as Eleonor Moore and her artistically gifted animals (whose activities will be followed by cleaning). Renovate the art connoisseur's museum, Giuseppe Clavier, and help the squat residents renovate their ruined house. House Flipper offers you various locations equipped with characteristic items.\n\nDECORATE INTERIORS\n\nBecome an interior designer and arrange interiors according to your own ideas, using available items and a wide range of paints. Most of the items available in the game have from several to over a dozen variants, which you will unlock as you progress in the game. Learn not only their purpose but also the story behind them (background). What does a cat have to do with haiku writing? Why are the Babylonian invaders buying souvenirs there? You will find answers to more strange questions in the descriptions of over 500 items available in the game. All this in realistic 3D graphics!\n\nGAIN EXPERIENCE\n\nAs you progress in House Flipper, you'll level up and improve your tools. Advance to the next levels to complete the tasks (quests) faster. Why hurt your hands when you can have gloves made of hardened smurf leather? Using unlocked items, you can arrange the interior of your office according to your own design. It can be stylish, but also ... A cat tree in the middle of the room? Why not? It's your idea after all!\n\nBUY, RENEW, DECOR, SELL\n\nYou can unlock new items, buy various, though not always beautiful houses with cash and flipcoins acquired during orders. Renovate your new house and turn it into your office, or negotiate a convenient sale price at real estate agency. It doesn't matter if you clean the Trash in M5 or polish the Crimson Corner. Each of them can become your haven on the path of developing your own career in the house flipping industry or a source of additional profit.",

      "description": "Do you want to help Elsa and work as a designer in our interior design games? Are you a makeover master and can build a house from scratch? Do you enjoy house design and merge games? If your answer is yes, then join Elsa on her journey and play Merge Hotel Empire house design games!\n\nHer whole life, Elsa has been working as a salesperson while cherishing her dream to design, decorate, and open her very own hotel. She made her dream come true on her 30th birthday, when she finally left her job and bought a house in the suburbs to open a small hotel for families.\n\nElsa found her dream house in a very bad condition. It looks nothing like the photos! Soon enough Elsa realized that the manor she had purchased will require a lot more renovation that she had initially thought. The mansion was far from free and she was greatly deceived with the deal she was offered, but she took it anyway. Perhaps you can turn it into a beautiful designer building together with our heroine!\n\nBut the mansion games are not as simple as just decorating houses and taking care of the garden. There is another hotel in town, the owner of which is determined to eliminate all competition. To make it work, Elsa has to take up interior design and home design, renovate every single room, welcome guests and earn enough money to start her own hotel network. Are you up for the challenge?\n\nAnother plot twist that Elsa wasn’t ready for is the “curse of hoteliers” that hangs over the city for many years. Nobody’s decor skills have been able to lift it, so Elsa will be the next one to try. Only she can unravel the tangle of intrigues and bring the hotel to prosperity! Put your seatbelt on and prepare for a ride with our merge and home design games!\n\n“My home needs help!”, Elsa thinks. Together, you can match and merge objects to create valuable tools that will help you. Merge Hotel Empire decorating games offer an opportunity to relax and submerge yourself in the exciting world of hospitality. If you enjoy design home and makeover games, you will definitely enjoy Merge Hotel Empire. Help make Elsa’s dream come true.\n\nThe mystery mansion is not as sweet and fun as it seems. There is some dark magic going on in the villa and you need to solve this puzzle. Flip the story upside down, escape your evil competitors, and decorate room after room in our merge game. Your designing contribution to the house games matters!",

To set the default line type: open the drawing tool, tap on the line type button (the squiggle icon in the top left corner of the drawing tool); then tap on the settings icon (on the right side above the Photos button); tap the checkbox next to the line that should be the new default line\n- Within the the new drawing tool settings, you can now hide lines from the list by tapping the ‘x’ button next to a line; tap the ‘x’ button again to unhide.\n- A new pressure sensitive brush tool has been added to the drawing tool. If you want to use CREATE mostly for freehand drawing, set this brush as the default line type. More brushes will be added soon\n- A second ‘Save color’ button is now displayed within the color picker when you attempt to save the color of an object that uses different colors for its stroke and fill. You can save each of these colors independently. To save a color: add an object on the canvas; apply a custom color; tap the colors icon (above the Photos in the bottom toolbar) to open the color picker; then tap the elipsis (3 dots) on the right side to open the save color tool; the save color buttons are located at the top of the left column.\n\nSome fixed bugs:\n- Fixed an issue importing a json file (editable .create file) from the Files app, if the file is unsynced to the current device, CREATE might previously get stuck fetching from iCloud\n- Fixed an issue when setting and resetting the default canvas size\n- Fixed an issue when dragging the cursor to select multiple words within a text box that contains multiple rows of text, the text box now remains stationary\n- the auto-suggested text row is only displayed when a CJK keyboard is selected; you can override this in the device settings\n\nLots of other minor UI edits:\n- There’s an updated order of the list of settings in the side menu\n- A new icon is used to delete a layer in the right side menu\n- There’s a fade effect at the bottom of the canvas size picker\n- There are many other edits and tweaks throughout the app\n\nCheck out the help center for instructions or email questions to: we@create.mobi\nCheck out projects made with CREATE at: twitter.com/Content\n\nKeep exploring, learning, creating!",

      "description": "You and your partner have just moved to a new home in the suburbs with your furry companion, an adorable cat named Snow. What to do first? Let's clean up so you can start decorating!\n\nThere's a couch, a table and a TV stand but not much else. What's missing here?! Oh... silly me, a TV of course. Let's buy that first!\n\nBut we can't just watch TV all day. Your partner needs to work and you have important chores around the house to do. Be sure to prepare meals for your partner and feed your kitty (or multiple, kitties as the case may be) to earn love. \n\nUse that love to buy more furniture, decorations, and yes... more CATS for your house to make it utterly adorable! The more cats you have, the more adorable moments you'll get. Capture them in snapshots with your retro camera and collect them all in your photo album.\n\nReally enjoying the game?!? Gather enough love and unlock new areas like the Garden where you can gather love from woodland creatures that come to visit your adorable home.\n\nAdorable Home is a passive and relaxing experience. Come back and check in on the game every couple hours to see something new, gather some love, and continue furnishing your home.\n\nWe hope you enjoy!\n\nAdorable Home is LGBTQ+ friendly. It references mature themes and on occasion, depicts characters in revealing outfits; this is a game about partners inside their home (Bedroom, Bathroom, etc.) after all. It may be inappropriate for children.",

        "description": "You and your partner have just moved to a new home in the suburbs with your furry companion, an adorable cat named Snow. What to do first? Let's clean up so you can start decorating!\n\nThere's a couch, a table and a TV stand but not much else. What's missing here?! Oh... silly me, a TV of course. Let's buy that first!\n\nBut we can't just watch TV all day. Your partner needs to work and you have important chores around the house to do. Be sure to prepare meals for your partner and feed your kitty (or multiple, kitties as the case may be) to earn love. \n\nUse that love to buy more furniture, decorations, and yes... more CATS for your house to make it utterly adorable! The more cats you have, the more adorable moments you'll get. Capture them in snapshots with your retro camera and collect them all in your photo album.\n\nReally enjoying the game?!? Gather enough love and unlock new areas like the Garden where you can gather love from woodland creatures that come to visit your adorable home.\n\nAdorable Home is a passive and relaxing experience. Come back and check in on the game every couple hours to see something new, gather some love, and continue furnishing your home.\n\nWe hope you enjoy!\n\nAdorable Home is LGBTQ+ friendly. It references mature themes and on occasion, depicts characters in revealing outfits; this is a game about partners inside their home (Bedroom, Bathroom, etc.) after all. It may be inappropriate for children.",

Get inspired by Crashing fellow designers in the Design Crasher Lounge and by cloning their designs to add your own personal touches.

Let Crashers know what you think about their designs directly under their post!\n\nWait, but what is a Crasher? Design Crasher users are considered Crashers. Crashers are the best type of creators. They inspire one another and are ready to share their designs with the world. Do you have what it takes to be a Crasher?\n\nClone – Are we seeing double? Creativity includes building on one another’s ideas. Like a Crasher’s design? Clone it and make it your own with your personal touches. When you clone a Crasher’s design, you’re making a copy of what it looks like at that time. Remember, you can then edit it to your liking. Cloning is the best way to collaborate on designs.\n\nLike something you see? Give it a “like”! “Likes” let Crashers know you appreciate their work. The more “likes” a design gets – the more Crashers get exposure. Interior design now made easy!\n\nCompete in challenges!

        "description": "Get ready to be inspired! Create and build beautiful interior designs and see them come to life in 3D. Choose the dimensions of your room and customize everything from home decor to flooring to wall treatments to furniture to accessories and more! When you’re done, share your room designs with other Crashers in the Design Crasher Lounge, accessible within our home and interior design app.\n\nCreate – It’s in the name! Create the interior of your dream room or use the dimensions of your existing space to recreate it in 3D design within Design Crasher. Choose from our constantly updated selection of decor, accessories, fixings, and more.\n\nStuck? Get inspired by Crashing fellow designers in the Design Crasher Lounge and by cloning their designs to add your own personal touches. Don’t forget to check out your space in the 3D viewer mode to bring it to life!\n\nCrash and be crashed. Design Crasher is about community. Find Crashers that inspire your creativity and crash them. When you crash someone on Design Crasher, you’ll see their latest designs, who they are crashing, and stay up to date on their designs. Have a question or comment? Let Crashers know what you think about their designs directly under their post!\n\nWait, but what is a Crasher? Design Crasher users are considered Crashers. Crashers are the best type of creators. They inspire one another and are ready to share their designs with the world. Do you have what it takes to be a Crasher?\n\nClone – Are we seeing double? Creativity includes building on one another’s ideas. Like a Crasher’s design? Clone it and make it your own with your personal touches. When you clone a Crasher’s design, you’re making a copy of what it looks like at that time. Remember, you can then edit it to your liking. Cloning is the best way to collaborate on designs.\n\nLike something you see? Give it a “like”! “Likes” let Crashers know you appreciate their work. The more “likes” a design gets – the more Crashers get exposure. Interior design now made easy!\n\nCompete in challenges! Every Sunday, we release a new design challenge for you to put your design skills to the test. To enter, design the given room according to the challenge rules to have a chance at being crowned that week’s Design Challenge Winner. Not only does your design get featured on all our social media channels, but you also get bragging rights for the week!\n\nHappy Crashing, Crashers!",
