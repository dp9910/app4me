      "description": "How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\n\n\nThere are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n\n\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.\n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.\n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\nTo get access to the I am Premium content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly, and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

        "description": "How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\n\n\nThere are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n\n\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.\n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.\n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\nTo get access to the I am Premium content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly, and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "description": "“We do not decide our future. We decide our habits and our habits decide our future.”\n\nEden is your new habits tracker companion app. It helps you create and maintain your daily habits and goals.\n\n\n==============\nWhat set it apart?\n==============\n\nFor each day you complete your tasks, you will grow a flower little by little. As long as you keep your habits, you will grow a garden and fill it with flowers! It is designed to be a relaxing, non-stressful app that encourages you to make small steps everyday and progress at your own pace.\n\n\n==============\nHow does it work?\n==============\n\n◆ Create your daily habits, tasks or goals you wish to achieve every day.\n◆ Each day, if you mark them all as achieved, a plant will flower, step by step.\n◆ However, if you don’t achieve your tasks, a part of the flower will fade away.\n◆ Each day, your tasks are automatically refreshed (to do again).\n◆ As long as you take care of you, you will take care of your garden.\n\n\n==============\nWhat else?\n==============\n\n◆ A simple, clean, minimalist design.\n◆ Very simple to use.\n◆ Reminder and timer to help you focus.\n◆ Widget to put your garden on your home screen.\n◆ No fancy graphics or complex statistics. Focus on today and what you want to accomplish.\n◆ Images, ambient sounds & music for you to customize your app.\n◆ You can use the app freely to grow your first flower. Get the premium version to grow them all.\n\n\n==============\nAnd one more thing.\n==============\n\nWhat we do and repeat everyday eventually defines what we are and what life we live. With the right habits, it is quite simple (but never easy) to bring balance, harmony, satisfaction and discipline in our life.\nHabits are not only things we do with our hands and feet, but also our mind: what we think about, how often we express gratitude or make compliments.\nWith this in mind, we wish you a happy life, and if our app helped you along the way, stop by to say \"Hello\". :)\n\n***\nIf you have any question, suggestion or feedback, please email us at hello@millefeuille.agency. We also appreciate it if you can leave us your rating and review to support our app.\nHave a nice day!\n\n***\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://millefeuille.agency/privacy-policy/",

With the right habits, it is quite simple (but never easy) to bring balance, harmony, satisfaction and discipline in our life.\nHabits are not only things we do with our hands and feet, but also our mind: what we think about, how often we express gratitude or make compliments.\nWith this in mind, we wish you a happy life, and if our app helped you along the way, stop by to say \"Hello\". :)\n\n***\nIf you have any question, suggestion or feedback, please email us at hello@millefeuille.agency.

      "description": "H&E is the leading monthly magazine aimed at naturists and all those who enjoy any aspects of their lifestyle without the restrictions of clothing. H&E originally stood for “health and efficiency”, the theory being that continued exposure to the sun and air, in combination with a good diet and regular exercise, was beneficial to health and made the body work more efficiently. Nowadays, naturism is more of a lifestyle choice with much less importance placed on the perfect body image – and more emphasis on travel, sunbathing, naked activities and, most of all, fun.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a free app download.

        "description": "H&E is the leading monthly magazine aimed at naturists and all those who enjoy any aspects of their lifestyle without the restrictions of clothing. H&E originally stood for “health and efficiency”, the theory being that continued exposure to the sun and air, in combination with a good diet and regular exercise, was beneficial to health and made the body work more efficiently. Nowadays, naturism is more of a lifestyle choice with much less importance placed on the perfect body image – and more emphasis on travel, sunbathing, naked activities and, most of all, fun.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a free app download.

      "description": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus.

      "description": "Disco is where gay dating gets real. Forget swipe fatigue and faceless chats on grinder or hornet. This is dating with charm, conversation, and connection. Whether you’re looking for love, new friends, or someone to dance through life with, Disco is your space to meet meaningful matches and share real moments.\n\nWhy Disco?\n\nUnlike other gay apps, Disco isn’t about abs or algorithms—it’s about chemistry. Inspired by the joy of a gay night out, it captures the feeling of locking eyes across a room, laughing under neon lights, or texting someone after a perfect first date. It's designed for guys who want more, who want something (or someone) real.\n\nKey Features:\n\nFlirty Matching – Find guys near you who are open to more than a one-night thing.\n\nReal Profiles – No faceless torsos. No spam. Just good vibes and authentic connection.\n\nMeaningful Messaging – Start deeper convos with smart prompts and shared interests.\n\nRomantic Vibes – Disco is full of sparks, not pressure. Meet guys at your own rhythm.\n\nQueer Community Focus – Built for gay men who want dating with emotion, joy, and depth.\n\nWhether you’re new in town, fresh out of a relationship, or just tired of the same old apps, Disco helps you find your people. This is dating for gay men who want it all: the flirt, the feels, and maybe even the forever.\n\nPopular With:\n\nGay & bi men looking for love or something real\n\nMen aged 20–45 who value connection and community\n\nLGBTQ+ folks who still believe in good gay love stories\n\nReady for a night out… from your couch?\nDownload Disco now and feel the difference.\n\nDISCLAIMERS, PRIVACY, AND LEGAL\nImages are for illustrative purposes only\nGPS usage may decrease battery life\nJaumo is free to download and use\nPremium features require a subscription\n\nhttps://jaumo.com/privacy\nhttps://jaumo.com/terms",

We’ve spent years collecting and curating the content — so that you wouldn’t have to work as long and hard to get there as we did.\n\nMastering your mindset will change your life. Download Studio Think today, and get ready to take back control of your future.\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN\nOur courses cover the most in-demand areas of personal growth, including Success, Manifestation, Resilience, Self-Confidence, Money and Happiness. And we keep adding new ones.\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO ACTION\nKnowledge is power — but only if you act on it. Our advanced toolkit makes it easy to act on everything you learn from our Mindset Courses. It includes techniques from Guided Meditations and Affirmation Mixes to Breathwork — so you can move from theory to practice straight away.\n\nYOU’RE BUSY. WE GET IT.\nWhen we founded Studio Think, we were juggling full-time careers with parenting and building our first ever business — so we know how busy life can get. We’ve built an app that’s life-compatible, making self-growth as quick and simple as grabbing a cup of your favourite hot beverage.\n \n\nWHAT’S INSIDE\n•\tA variety of short, actionable 6-day MINDSET COURSES designed to help you learn how to change your mindset in only 15 minutes a day.\n•\t20+ MINDSET TOOLS, tips and tricks to help you train your mind like a pro.\n•\tA selection of GUIDED MEDITATIONS for a deeper transformation of your subconscious mind.\n•\t30+ short AFFIRMATION MIXES (3-5min) for reprogramming your thoughts.\n•\tA BREATHWORK STUDIO full of techniques to bring your body and mind together.\n•\tA selection of SELF-COACHING PROGRAMMES to help you understand yourself better and unlock your mindset to achieve your goals. \n•\tPROGRESS TRACKER to help you keep up your healthy new habit.\n•\tNew content added regularly.\n\nSTAY ON COURSE\nSelf-development is the healthiest habit of all — and we’ll help you keep it up. The App will remind you to rate your growth every 7 days. Your Progress page will reflect how consistent you’ve been. And there’s motivational reminders to help as well.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nGetting started with Studio Think is simple. As soon as you download the App, you’ll find all the courses and tools in one place — with brief introductions to each one.\n\nThe 7-day free trial will let you test-drive every single course and tool. \nIf you like what you see and hear, please continue with us for a monthly or annual plan. Unlimited self-development for the price of one cup of coffee per month — we reckon even Warren Buffett would call that a smart investment. \n\nSPEND A LITTLE, LEARN A LOT\nTo keep things simple, we only have two plans. \n\nMONTHLY : 7-day free trial, then £9.99/month.\nANNUAL : 7-day free trial, then £47.99/year — that’s just £4.00/month.\n\nOVER TO YOU\nQuestions? Suggestions? Fan mail? We would love to hear from you.  \nDrop us a line: hello@studiothinkapp.com\n\nCANCELLATION POLICY\nPayment is charged to the credit card connected to your iTunes account.

        "description": "Studio Think. Say hello to your best self. \n\nThere’s only one person who can change your life: you. And it all starts with your mind. \nThat’s the simple truth behind Studio Think: the App that helps you change your life for the better in less than 15 minutes a day, by changing your mindset.\n\nStudio Think makes personal development easy. Think of it as a mindset coach in your pocket, giving you all the resources you need to create the life you want to live. It gives you 24/7 access to the best of personal development literature, knowledge and tools, carefully curated by top-notch coaching experts, in a format that fits into even the busiest of schedules. We’ve spent years collecting and curating the content — so that you wouldn’t have to work as long and hard to get there as we did.\n\nMastering your mindset will change your life. Download Studio Think today, and get ready to take back control of your future.\n\nWHAT YOU’LL LEARN\nOur courses cover the most in-demand areas of personal growth, including Success, Manifestation, Resilience, Self-Confidence, Money and Happiness. And we keep adding new ones.\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO ACTION\nKnowledge is power — but only if you act on it. Our advanced toolkit makes it easy to act on everything you learn from our Mindset Courses. It includes techniques from Guided Meditations and Affirmation Mixes to Breathwork — so you can move from theory to practice straight away.\n\nYOU’RE BUSY. WE GET IT.\nWhen we founded Studio Think, we were juggling full-time careers with parenting and building our first ever business — so we know how busy life can get. We’ve built an app that’s life-compatible, making self-growth as quick and simple as grabbing a cup of your favourite hot beverage.\n \n\nWHAT’S INSIDE\n•\tA variety of short, actionable 6-day MINDSET COURSES designed to help you learn how to change your mindset in only 15 minutes a day.\n•\t20+ MINDSET TOOLS, tips and tricks to help you train your mind like a pro.\n•\tA selection of GUIDED MEDITATIONS for a deeper transformation of your subconscious mind.\n•\t30+ short AFFIRMATION MIXES (3-5min) for reprogramming your thoughts.\n•\tA BREATHWORK STUDIO full of techniques to bring your body and mind together.\n•\tA selection of SELF-COACHING PROGRAMMES to help you understand yourself better and unlock your mindset to achieve your goals. \n•\tPROGRESS TRACKER to help you keep up your healthy new habit.\n•\tNew content added regularly.\n\nSTAY ON COURSE\nSelf-development is the healthiest habit of all — and we’ll help you keep it up. The App will remind you to rate your growth every 7 days. Your Progress page will reflect how consistent you’ve been. And there’s motivational reminders to help as well.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nGetting started with Studio Think is simple. As soon as you download the App, you’ll find all the courses and tools in one place — with brief introductions to each one.\n\nThe 7-day free trial will let you test-drive every single course and tool. \nIf you like what you see and hear, please continue with us for a monthly or annual plan. Unlimited self-development for the price of one cup of coffee per month — we reckon even Warren Buffett would call that a smart investment. \n\nSPEND A LITTLE, LEARN A LOT\nTo keep things simple, we only have two plans. \n\nMONTHLY : 7-day free trial, then £9.99/month.\nANNUAL : 7-day free trial, then £47.99/year — that’s just £4.00/month.\n\nOVER TO YOU\nQuestions? Suggestions? Fan mail? We would love to hear from you.  \nDrop us a line: hello@studiothinkapp.com\n\nCANCELLATION POLICY\nPayment is charged to the credit card connected to your iTunes account. The subscription will automatically renew unless turned off in your iTunes account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the 7-day free trial or current subscription period.
