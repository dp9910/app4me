      "description": "NEVER RECORD OR EDIT A VIDEO AGAIN\n\nBuilt by MIRAGE™, Captions is an AI video generator and editor that makes it easy to create talking videos. It’s designed for creators and small businesses—no professional editor or special skills required. \n\nMake the videos you’ve always dreamed of, all in one app. Just take a selfie to make your AI twin, then use your twin for new footage. Type what you want in your video, and you’ll have quality footage in minutes. \n\nUse Captions’ AI editing tools to turn your video into social-ready content. Type your vision, and our tools do the rest. Describe a style you like or reference trending aesthetics, and our tools will automatically apply stylized effects, generated B-roll, and more. Since Captions was made for talking videos, you’ll get better outputs. Just download the final video and you’re ready to go.  \n\nYou can also use Captions to make videos more accessible with auto-generated captions, dubbing, and subtitles. Choose from a range of languages to make as many versions as you need. \n\nCUSTOM AVATARS \n-Selfie to Video: Use a selfie to generate your AI twin, then use it for future videos. \n-AI Actors: Pick from a wide selection of avatars who can star in your videos. \n-Adjust Looks: Transform your selfie for unlimited possibilities. You can change its appearance, outfit and even background to reuse the same twin for future videos.\n\nVIDEOS IN MINUTES \n-Text to Video: Create new videos with simple prompts. We’ll generate a full script and edited output video.   \n-AI Editing: Use the chat box to describe your edits, and our tools will automatically apply changes or effects. Simple text will make changes like transitions, pacing or even adding B-roll. \n-AI Teleprompter: When you record with our camera, you can read from your script directly in the app. \n\nAI EDITING TOOLS \n-AI Eye Contact: Correct your eye contact so you’re always looking right at the viewer, no matter how you originally filmed the clip.\n-AI Denoise: Automatically remove background noise from talking videos you filmed yourself.\n-AI Zoom: Instantly add relevant zooms, related to your content.\n-AI Scale: Quickly resize videos for whatever aspect ratio you need.\n-AI Hashtags: Automatically generate suggested video captions and hashtags.\n-Multiple Models: Choose from more than 20+ models to generate details like music, sounds and images.  \n\nCAPTIONS AND DUBBING \n-AI Captions: Automatically generate accurate captions or subtitles in 100+ languages. You can choose specific fonts or colors, too.\n-AI Dubbing: Dub your content into 29 languages, with just a tap of a button.\n\nThese features require an active Captions subscription",

        "description": "NEVER RECORD OR EDIT A VIDEO AGAIN\n\nBuilt by MIRAGE™, Captions is an AI video generator and editor that makes it easy to create talking videos. It’s designed for creators and small businesses—no professional editor or special skills required. \n\nMake the videos you’ve always dreamed of, all in one app. Just take a selfie to make your AI twin, then use your twin for new footage. Type what you want in your video, and you’ll have quality footage in minutes. \n\nUse Captions’ AI editing tools to turn your video into social-ready content. Type your vision, and our tools do the rest. Describe a style you like or reference trending aesthetics, and our tools will automatically apply stylized effects, generated B-roll, and more. Since Captions was made for talking videos, you’ll get better outputs. Just download the final video and you’re ready to go.  \n\nYou can also use Captions to make videos more accessible with auto-generated captions, dubbing, and subtitles. Choose from a range of languages to make as many versions as you need. \n\nCUSTOM AVATARS \n-Selfie to Video: Use a selfie to generate your AI twin, then use it for future videos. \n-AI Actors: Pick from a wide selection of avatars who can star in your videos. \n-Adjust Looks: Transform your selfie for unlimited possibilities. You can change its appearance, outfit and even background to reuse the same twin for future videos.\n\nVIDEOS IN MINUTES \n-Text to Video: Create new videos with simple prompts. We’ll generate a full script and edited output video.   \n-AI Editing: Use the chat box to describe your edits, and our tools will automatically apply changes or effects. Simple text will make changes like transitions, pacing or even adding B-roll. \n-AI Teleprompter: When you record with our camera, you can read from your script directly in the app. \n\nAI EDITING TOOLS \n-AI Eye Contact: Correct your eye contact so you’re always looking right at the viewer, no matter how you originally filmed the clip.\n-AI Denoise: Automatically remove background noise from talking videos you filmed yourself.\n-AI Zoom: Instantly add relevant zooms, related to your content.\n-AI Scale: Quickly resize videos for whatever aspect ratio you need.\n-AI Hashtags: Automatically generate suggested video captions and hashtags.\n-Multiple Models: Choose from more than 20+ models to generate details like music, sounds and images.  \n\nCAPTIONS AND DUBBING \n-AI Captions: Automatically generate accurate captions or subtitles in 100+ languages. You can choose specific fonts or colors, too.\n-AI Dubbing: Dub your content into 29 languages, with just a tap of a button.\n\nThese features require an active Captions subscription",

      "description": "Teleprompter for Video makes it easy to create professional-looking videos on your iPhone or iPad. Simply read from the prompter while recording video. \n\nIt's perfect for anyone wanting to record a vlog, practise a speech or give a business communication.

      "description": "Create mesmerizing 15-second video collages that capture the moments of your life in a unique and memorable way. Introducing Cinepic.\n\nCapture The Moment\nWhen you remember an event in your life, a central image pops in your head and then cascades into a collection of supporting moments. This is exactly how Cinepic works. More than a photo and more than a video, a Cinepic captures *the essence* of an occasion - the feeling of being there.\n\nJump Right In\nCinepic is a template-driven video collage generator. Just assign a background image and foreground videos to one of eight templates and watch your Cinepic come to life. Add a song from your music library to make it even more memorable.\n\nExplore Your Creativity\nEvery action in the creation of your Cinepic is reflected in real-time, encouraging, and inspiring experimentation towards the perfect balance. Every element of a Cinepic - image, video, layout, and music - can be changed at any time without having to start over.\n\nShare Your World\nA Cinepic is optimized for Instagram, Facebook, and anywhere autoplay video is enabled. Its compact size and highly visual nature make it perfect for messaging.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nRemove Watermark + Remove Ads Yearly subscription\n• 1 Year with all animation packs, remove watermark & remove ads, first Week is completely free\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nTERMS OF USE\nhttp://www.globalfitnessapps.com/termsofuse.html\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttp://www.globalfitnessapps.com/privacypolicy.html",

From image creation to full-motion video clips, IRMO leverages latest AI art technologies to make your dreams come true.\n\nFrom Imagination to Animation:\n • Bring whimsical animated loops to your phone’s wallpaper or lock screen.\n • Add dynamic flair to your YouTube thumbnails or TikTok intros.\n • Transform simple product images into eye-catching promotional clips.\n • Design unique moving artworks to grace your office walls or personal galleries.\n\nIRMO’s Vision:\nWe believe that everyone has a world of stories inside them.
