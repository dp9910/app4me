      "description": "FEATURE-RICH: PewPee has a lot of useful features. Download music; create your own playlists; add playlists, albums, songs, artists to your library; request music; follow friends; check new releases, top charts, popular playlists, artists; find music by genres; listen in a shuffle mode; set up a sleep timer AND SO ON!\n\nZERO ADS: Yeah, we don’t have any ads.\n\nMILLIONS OF SONGS: We have a huge music catalogue including more than 150 million songs from YouTube too.\n\nLYRICS: It’s always easier to jam out to your latest favorite song when you know the words. See the lyrics of many of your favorite tracks as they’re sung right from the player or by tapping on View Lyrics in the context menu of a song.\n\nFEED: Just bring your friends and start sharing your activity with each other. You can not only see the updates of your friends but also open new songs for yourself or maybe a new taste in music.\n\nIMPORT YOUR MUSIC: PewPee delivers its own library to you (and we increase the number of songs every day). However, if you can’t find something you want, with the subscription you are able to import any music (MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, etc.) from your device or use cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.\n\nPRIVACY: We don’t provide your data to third-party services. We only store the data that PewPee needs to function as a feature-rich music streaming service.\n\nSIMPLE: We believe that apps must have a large number of features and save simplicity in design. PewPee takes care to keep the UI clean and good looking.\n\nMORE: PewPee is actively continuing to make the service better and better. We have big plans to improve and create an array of features. Stay tuned by following us on social networks.\n\nTerms of Service: https://pewpee.com/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://pewpee.com/privacy\n\nTelegram: @pewpee_music\nTwitter: @PewPeeMusic\nInstagram: @pewpee.music",

With our mobile app, you can browse the entire Splice catalog all from your phone. Dive deep into packs and genres and discover hidden gems. Search by keyword and filter by tags to find the perfect sound for your project. Quickly audition loops, tap the heart icon to save your favorite sounds, and organize them into Collections. \n\nVOICE TO VERSE—ANYWHERE \nThe latest mobile feature, Splice Mic, redefines mobile music creation for songwriters who know inspiration doesn’t wait. More than just a recording app, it lets you hear every topline, verse, or riff in full musical context over Splice sounds—right from your phone. Instantly test ideas, explore genres, and unlock new creative possibilities.\n\nHumming a melody? Strumming a riff? Working out lyrics? Splice Mic turns spontaneous moments into real musical opportunities. Every take is a step toward your next track. When you're ready, export to your DAW and turn those mobile ideas into full songs.\n\nINSTANT INSPIRATION WITH CREATE MODE\nGenerating new musical ideas and starting beats on the go has never been easier. Simply tap on the Create icon, select your desired genre, and immediately drop into a Stack of loops from the Splice library. You may find the generated Stack fits what you’re looking for perfectly, but if not, that’s great too. Developing a musical idea is often about trying combinations of sounds and figuring out what feels good to you—Create Mode is a great companion for that process. \n\nCreate Mode leaves creative control in your hands—shuffle to create a whole new Stack or add new layers of compatible sounds and your own recordings. If you want to replace a single loop with a new option of the same type of sound, swipe right. If you want to delete the layer altogether, swipe left. You can also solo a layer by holding down, or tap the layer to mute. Once you’ve chosen your Stack layers, you can fine-tune your loop with volume adjustments and BPM control. When your idea hits the spot, save it with a click. You can also click the Stack icon to hear any individual loop in the Splice library in musical context with Create mode. \n\nSAVE IT. SEND IT. SHARE IT.\nCreating and saving your Stack is just the beginning. Not only is the Stack accessible from anywhere you can access your Splice account, but you can also share it directly with a unique link, AirDrop it to friends, or upload to Dropbox, Drive, or another cloud service right from your device for seamless collaboration. If you work in Ableton Live or Studio One, you can export your Stack as a DAW file and open it up with key and tempo information synced when you’re back in the studio. You can also save as a bounced stereo mix to hear the full idea rendered.\n\nSTART WITH SPLICE\nSubscribe to use Splice's expansive library of royalty-free samples, presets, MIDI, and creative tools in your music.

      "description": "Radio Paradise streams highly curated, eclectic mixes of music -- chosen by real humans -- with unparalleled audio quality (enhanced by a dazzling photo slideshow, tied in thematically with the songs that are playing). You'll hear modern and classic rock, world music, electronica, and even a bit of classical and jazz — with no random computer-generated playlists, needless chatter, or commercials. The mix always includes a carefully-selected assortment of new songs & artists, many of which you won't hear anywhere else. Most selections are in English, but Radio Paradise always keeps an ear open for great music in other languages.\n\nOur specialty is taking a diverse assortment of songs and making them flow together in a way that makes sense harmonically, rhythmically, and lyrically — an art that, to us, is the very essence of radio. If you don't care for what's playing at the moment, you can skip ahead. Our streams are uncontaminated by either algorithms or capitalism.\n\nRadio Paradise is also a community. Each song is accompanied by thoughts and comments about it from your fellow Radio Paradise listeners.\n\nListening is always free. We are funded by listeners who like what we do, and pay money to help us keep doing it. For over two decades, Radio Paradise has been dedicated to preserving the art of radio DJ-ing and providing a soundtrack you can enjoy all day every day. Thanks for listening!\n\nInternet radio pioneers: First aired in February 2000\n4 eclectic music channels, with more coming soon\n16,000+ tracks in the active play library\n~1,000,000 tracks in the entire RP music library\n\nFree for everyone • No user data collection • No advertisements ever\n\nWe are consistently rated as one of the best internet radio stations worldwide in the media and online. \n\nDiscover why people all over the world make Radio Paradise their all-day everyday soundtrack.",

        "description": "Radio Paradise streams highly curated, eclectic mixes of music -- chosen by real humans -- with unparalleled audio quality (enhanced by a dazzling photo slideshow, tied in thematically with the songs that are playing). You'll hear modern and classic rock, world music, electronica, and even a bit of classical and jazz — with no random computer-generated playlists, needless chatter, or commercials. The mix always includes a carefully-selected assortment of new songs & artists, many of which you won't hear anywhere else. Most selections are in English, but Radio Paradise always keeps an ear open for great music in other languages.\n\nOur specialty is taking a diverse assortment of songs and making them flow together in a way that makes sense harmonically, rhythmically, and lyrically — an art that, to us, is the very essence of radio. If you don't care for what's playing at the moment, you can skip ahead. Our streams are uncontaminated by either algorithms or capitalism.\n\nRadio Paradise is also a community. Each song is accompanied by thoughts and comments about it from your fellow Radio Paradise listeners.\n\nListening is always free. We are funded by listeners who like what we do, and pay money to help us keep doing it. For over two decades, Radio Paradise has been dedicated to preserving the art of radio DJ-ing and providing a soundtrack you can enjoy all day every day. Thanks for listening!\n\nInternet radio pioneers: First aired in February 2000\n4 eclectic music channels, with more coming soon\n16,000+ tracks in the active play library\n~1,000,000 tracks in the entire RP music library\n\nFree for everyone • No user data collection • No advertisements ever\n\nWe are consistently rated as one of the best internet radio stations worldwide in the media and online. \n\nDiscover why people all over the world make Radio Paradise their all-day everyday soundtrack.",
