      "description": "Finally Understand What's Going On With Your Body\n\nTrusted by 12 million users who want to reconnect with their bodies and feel better, featured by the App Store in Apps We Love, and collaborating with 25+ universities worldwide — including Harvard Medical School, Arizona State University, and Johns Hopkins — to advance health science.\n\n— Your heart knows everything about you. Welltory helps you listen and understand —\n\nSometimes your body feels like it’s speaking a foreign language. Welltory translates those signals into science-backed insights — whether you’re facing hormonal changes, heart health concerns, fatigue, burnout, or just want to optimize energy and mood.\n\nWe analyze heart rate variability (HRV) — a proven heart health marker backed by 20,000+ studies — to show what your heart and nervous system reveal about your wellness.\n\n— Your Complete Health Story, One App —\n\nYou don’t have to piece together insights from 5 health apps. When you finally have a moment for yourself, everything you need is right there. \n\nConnect 1,000+ devices and apps — Apple Watch, Oura, meditation apps, lab test results, and more — to create your personal health diary. \n\n— Stop Guessing. Start Understanding —\n\nSleep That Actually Restores You\n\nStruggling with insomnia or waking up exhausted? Our Sleep Analysis goes beyond counting hours. Discover what disrupts your rest and get insights to improve recovery. With Echo — a science-based library of calming content tailored to your heartbeat — you’ll fall asleep faster and wake up truly restored.\n\nHeart Health & Blood Pressure Simplified \n\nYour heart reveals what’s really happening in your body. Welltory helps you track blood pressure, hypertension, and other metrics — plus log symptoms in your personal health diary. Share reports with your doctor, or use Welltory as a tracker helping you navigate health, menopause, and aging with confidence.\n\nCan Apple Watch measure blood pressure? No, but Welltory helps you understand your numbers if you sync a monitor or add data manually.\n\nStress That Makes Sense\n\nTurn your Apple Watch into a stress monitor and catch stress before it takes over. No more wondering “why am I so stressed?” — now you’ll know, and know how to respond. See how work, sleep, workouts, and even Zoom meetings affect your stress levels, and recognize when it’s time to pause and restore balance.\n\nActivity Boost Without Pressure\n\nTrack the 60% of activity most fitness apps ignore — we count every effort: walking the dog, house chores, running for the bus, and more. Every activity grows your Mountain in the app — the taller it gets, the more you’ve moved. We also set a Longevity goal that matches where your body is today and gently guides you toward progress, not perfection.\n\nStart listening to your body — and feel the difference with Welltory.\n\nPRICING & TERMS\n\nApp is free to download and use.

Our new reports help you understand these connections and see how your day truly shapes how you feel.\n\n— Battery Timeline. Watch your energy flow throughout the day. See when it drops, when it grows, and how your choices — rest, sleep, or movement — change the curve. Learn what really charges you and what drains you, one glance at a time.\n\n— Stress Timeline. See when your body is balanced and when it’s overloaded. Over time, you’ll start noticing clear patterns: some tasks wear you out, while others help you unwind. Knowing this, you can plan your day around what truly works for you — so tough moments become easier to handle.\n\n— Stress-Coping Curve. See how stress builds up through the day and how effectively you deal with it. This chart shows when tension starts rising — and when your actions help your body release it. It also brings an important insight: recovery isn’t accidental — it’s the result of specific actions. Knowing when to rest or move helps keep tension from becoming chronic and lets your energy return on time.\n\nStay tuned & rate us if you enjoy using Welltory.",

      "description": "WHOOP is the leading wearable that turns comprehensive health insights into daily action. By capturing dozens of data points every second, WHOOP delivers personalized Sleep, Strain, Recovery, Stress, and health insights—24/7. WHOOP uses those insights to provide coaching based on your body’s unique physiology and recommends everything from when to go to bed to new daily behaviors that will help you reach your goals.\n\nIf you’re new to WHOOP, you can try both the wearable and app free for 1 month. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nWHOOP is screenless, so all your data lives in the WHOOP app—for a distraction-free focus on your health. The WHOOP app requires a WHOOP wearable.\n\nHow it works:\n\nHealthspan*: A powerful way to quantify your age and slow your Pace of Aging. Backed by leading longevity research, it pinpoints the daily habits that impact your long-term health.\n\nSleep: WHOOP helps you understand how well you sleep each night by measuring your Sleep Performance. Every morning, WHOOP provides a Sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Planner calculates how much sleep you need to recover, tailored to your habits, schedule, and goals. You can even set a Haptic Alarm that wakes when you're fully rested, or at a specific time, with gentle vibration. Quality sleep is essential for improving your healthspan, metabolic mental resilience, recovery, and performance.\n\nRecovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You'll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 1 to 99%. When you're in the green, you're ready for strain, when you're in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program.\n\nStrain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity–it measures cardiovascular and muscular exertion to give you the most comprehensive view of the demands you put on your body. Each day, Strain Target will provide a Strain score from 0 to 21 and recommend your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score.\n\nStress: WHOOP gives you daily insights to pinpoint your stressors, understand your physiological response, and discover techniques to help manage. Get a real-time stress score from 0-3 and, based on your score, choose a breathwork session to enhance your alertness or increase relaxation.\n\nBehaviors: WHOOP tracks over 160+ daily habits and behaviors—like alcohol intake, medication, and more—to better understand how these behaviors impact your body. WHOOP provides weekly guidance for behavior change and helps set accountability goals with the Journal and Weekly Plan features.\n\nWHOOP Coach: Ask questions about your health & fitness and get highly personalized, on-demand answers. Using your unique biometric data, the latest performance science, and generative AI, WHOOP Coach generates responses on everything from training plans to why you’re feeling tired.\n\nMenstrual Cycle Insights: Go beyond period tracking to better understand your fifth vital sign and get tailored cycle-based insights.\n\nWhat else you can do in the WHOOP app:\n\n• Dig into the details: See heart rate zones, VO₂ Max, steps, and more trends over time to adjust your behaviors, training, sleep and more based on your goals.\n\n• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team's training is going.\n\n• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple's Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience.\n\nWHOOP provides products and services designed for general fitness and wellness purposes. WHOOP products and services are not medical devices, not intended to treat or diagnose any disease, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. All content available through WHOOP products and services is for general informational purposes only.\n\nDiscover the future of health and performance.\n\n*Some availability restrictions apply.",

Get a real-time stress score from 0-3 and, based on your score, choose a breathwork session to enhance your alertness or increase relaxation.\n\nBehaviors: WHOOP tracks over 160+ daily habits and behaviors—like alcohol intake, medication, and more—to better understand how these behaviors impact your body. WHOOP provides weekly guidance for behavior change and helps set accountability goals with the Journal and Weekly Plan features.\n\nWHOOP Coach: Ask questions about your health & fitness and get highly personalized, on-demand answers. Using your unique biometric data, the latest performance science, and generative AI, WHOOP Coach generates responses on everything from training plans to why you’re feeling tired.\n\nMenstrual Cycle Insights: Go beyond period tracking to better understand your fifth vital sign and get tailored cycle-based insights.\n\nWhat else you can do in the WHOOP app:\n\n• Dig into the details: See heart rate zones, VO₂ Max, steps, and more trends over time to adjust your behaviors, training, sleep and more based on your goals.\n\n• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team's training is going.\n\n• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple's Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience.\n\nWHOOP provides products and services designed for general fitness and wellness purposes.

Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics.

        "description": "98point6 by Transcarent provides on-demand consultation, diagnosis and treatment from board-certified clinicians and sends necessary prescriptions to your pharmacy—all via secure, in-app messaging. Our unique, text-based care delivery means you can get care conveniently, when and where you need it. No appointments, no travel. We're available nationwide, 24/7, 365 days a year. \n \n\nWHO IS TRANSCARENT? \nTranscarent is a health and care experience company that makes it easy for people to access high-quality, affordable health and care. The 98point6 by Transcarent app provides access to Transcarent’s on-demand virtual care clinic. \n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST? \nSome employers and health plans provide access to 98point6 by Transcarent at no charge and offer visits at low/no cost to eligible members and their dependents ages 1+. To see if you're eligible, please check with your health plan or employer. \nPlease note, the account holder must be 18+ to create an account and seek primary care; 19+ in Nebraska. \n \n\nWHO ARE YOUR DOCTORS? \nOur on-demand virtual clinic is staffed by carefully selected providers and board-certified physicians who are passionate about making care more accessible. Transcarent Clinic providers are specially trained to treat and diagnose via text-based care. (The 98point6 by Transcarent app supports photo, video and audio as needed.) \n \n\nWHAT CAN YOU TREAT? \nOur care team, including board-certified clinicians, are available on-demand to diagnose and treat, answer questions, offer peace of mind and when appropriate, guide you toward options for next steps.  \n \n\nCommon conditions we can treat or advise on include: \nCold, cough and flu \nUrinary tract infections (UTI) \nAcid reflux, heartburn and digestive issues \nDiagnosis and treatment via medications for anxiety and depression \nSkin conditions, rashes, bites and sunburn \nNausea, stomach flu and gastroenteritis \nGeneral health questions \nActivity and fitness \nNutrition and weight management \nWeight Health support and step counter for tracking physical activity \nStress management, relaxation, mental acuity \nDiseases and conditions management \nClinical Decision Support \nDisease prevention and public health \nHealthcare services and management \nMental and behavioral health \nMedical reference and education \nMedication and treatment management \nPhysical therapy and rehabilitation \nReproductive and sexual health \n...and more \n \n\nWHAT IS YOUR PRESCRIPTION POLICY? \nOur doctors can prescribe a wide variety of medications.

Our physicians adhere to evidence-based standards with respect to the responsible use of antibiotics. If we are unable to prescribe a medication, it's likely due to a combination of factors, including state and federal regulations related to virtual care practices, as well as what's in the best interest of patient safety and well-being. \n \n\nNote: 98point6 by Transcarent is not intended for medical emergencies. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 or immediately go to the nearest emergency room.",

Small wins sometimes mean more than the scale.” - Carol\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe Lark app is designed for personal health tracking for informational purposes only.

I lost 30 pounds. I had retired from boxing and came back to the sport with the support of my Vida coach – it’s unbelievable. I’m ready to jump back into the boxing ring again.

My diet has also completely changed, with more fruits and vegetables and grains. With these changes, I feel a lot more energetic and have clarity of mind.”\n- Chris, lost 25 pounds and reduced his elevated blood pressure\n\n“I feel empowered by being healthy, losing weight, going to the gym, cleaning my diet, and changing my perspective about life.

Our approach offers a drug-free option with exercises for the body and mind based on guidelines recommended by the American College of Physicians.\n\nKaia is offered exclusively to the individuals of our participating health insurance plans and employers at no cost.

It’s easy to use and the exercises are really helping. Much easier and cheaper than paying for a pilates training course…” Colin M. - Kaia User\n\n---\n\nFollow us and stay up to date:\nfacebook.com/kaiahealth\ntwitter.com/kaiahealth\n\nFor support, please visit our Help Center.\nYou can also contact our support team in app!\n\nPRIVACY & TERMS:\nhttps://www.kaiahealth.com/legal/privacy-policy/\nhttps://www.kaiahealth.com/legal/terms-conditions/\n\nThe Kaia Health App is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Our approach offers a drug-free option with exercises for the body and mind based on guidelines recommended by the American College of Physicians.\n\nKaia is offered exclusively to the individuals of our participating health insurance plans and employers at no cost. We are constantly expanding our coverage network and hope we can soon provide our best-in-class program to even more people in need of pain relief.\n\n▶ THE ADVANTAGES OF KAIA TRAINING:\n\n• DESIGNED BY MEDICAL EXPERTS: Kaia was developed by a team of doctors and pain specialists from Klinikum Rechts der Isar in Munich, Germany and is inspired by the “National Guidelines for the Treatment of LBP (Lower Back Pain)”.\n• PERSONALIZED TO EACH USER: Kaia actively adapts its exercises to each user’s pain level, pain localization, and daily feedback via intelligent algorithms. \n• USE AT HOME OR IN THE OFFICE: Kaia can be used anytime and anywhere at your own convenience.\n• HOLISTIC MIND-BODY TRAINING: Kaia combines a variety of mobility, strengthening, breathing, & wellness exercises to target both physical and psychological causes of pain.\n• EDUCATION: Kaia includes regular insights and learnings to teach users more about back and joint health, chronic pain, wellness, etc. \n• ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY: Kaia uses the latest technology including a motion tracking (through the smartphone camera) to track and correct your movement in real-time.\n• EXTRA SUPPORT: Kaia offers on-call professional health coaches to further assist users with insight, instruction, and motivation.\n\n▶ HOW KAIA WORKS:\n\n• DAILY CHECK-IN: Start every session with a quick self-assessment of pain intensity and sleep quality.\n• PERSONALIZED ROUTINE: Kaia sets up a combination of mobility, strengthening, and breathing exercises within a 15-minute routine.\n• DEMO VIDEOS: Each exercise begins with a high-quality demo to give you optimal guidance\n• FEEDBACK: Give your feedback regularly to further personalize and improve your exercises.\n• PROGRESS & MOTIVATION: Kaia tracks your training and keeps you motivated towards your health goals.\n\n▶ WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM KAIA: \n\n• Smart and simple daily routines designed to build strength, mobility, and awareness.\n• Physio-therapeutic strengthening exercises that stabilize the entire musculature of the spine.\n• Psychological relaxation exercises that target mental wellness and pain perception.\n• Extensive knowledge and insights on how to relieve pain, manage chronic pain, improve spine health, improve posture, build muscle, structure physical therapy, and more. \n\n▶ WHAT KAIA USERS SAY:\n\n“Kaia can help you stand up to back pain and poor posture.” - Apple App Store\n\n“This app is so well thought out combining movement, relaxation, and knowledge––the three things (I am learning) that I can use to control my pain. It’s easy to use and the exercises are really helping. Much easier and cheaper than paying for a pilates training course…” Colin M. - Kaia User\n\n---\n\nFollow us and stay up to date:\nfacebook.com/kaiahealth\ntwitter.com/kaiahealth\n\nFor support, please visit our Help Center.\nYou can also contact our support team in app!\n\nPRIVACY & TERMS:\nhttps://www.kaiahealth.com/legal/privacy-policy/\nhttps://www.kaiahealth.com/legal/terms-conditions/\n\nThe Kaia Health App is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

GROIN FITNESS - Additional training to accelerate results\n\nPerform special exercises for the groin area, that increase blood flow to the groin area & strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\n\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training & helps to achieve desired results faster.\n\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor your results & increase the chance of success\n\nTake measurements & visualize your progress in clear graphs. Be sure that you are getting real results & boost your motivation to move forward.\n\n4.

        "description": "The Dr. Kegel app provides men with 6 exceptional features that form a comprehensive solution for improving intimate, overall & mental health.\n\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve men's health\n\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles.\n\nThese are the muscles that stretch from the tailbone to the pubic bone. PF muscles play a key role in erectile function, ejaculation, bladder & bowel control. Without training, the PF muscles lose tone. This can impair the above-mentioned functions.\n\nBut just like you can build up your biceps with workouts, you can strengthen PF muscles with Kegel Training & improve men's health.\n\nKegels aka Pelvic Floor exercises are equally effective for men who feel well, as well as for those with health problems. This is confirmed by the latest studies in which 75.5% [1] of men with ED & 82.5% [2] of men with PE achieved improvements.\n\nKegel Training can help you achieve impressive results. Because according to the latest user survey, up to 84% of users reported improvements.\n\n- It's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\n- The workouts take just 5 minutes a day;\n- Simply follow clear & intuitive instructions to contract PF muscles to the rhythm of your phone's vibration;\n- You can work out in any place, position & situation. Nobody can notice;\n- No extra equipment is needed;\n- The difficulty automatically adjusts to you.\n\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Additional training to accelerate results\n\nPerform special exercises for the groin area, that increase blood flow to the groin area & strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\n\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training & helps to achieve desired results faster.\n\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor your results & increase the chance of success\n\nTake measurements & visualize your progress in clear graphs. Be sure that you are getting real results & boost your motivation to move forward.\n\n4. MIND CLEANER - Take care of your mental health\n\nMind Cleaner allows you to relieve stress, anxiety & depression with an effective psychological technique. This positively affects your self-esteem & mental well-being.\n\n5. DAILY CHALLENGES - Take simple steps to improve your lifestyle\n\nComplete simple activities to build healthy habits for your physical & mental health, social life & eating behavior, as all of them have an immense effect on your male welfare.\n\n6. INSIGHTS LIBRARY - Discover the latest scientific facts about Men's Health, Relationships, Nutrition & more\n\nGet verified and straightforward answers to the most popular topics made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations. Incorporate valuable tips from Insights into your daily life to improve its quality, and be more productive and mindful.\n\nAll THE ABOVE MAKES DR. KEGEL IS A COMPLEX SOLUTION FOR IMPROVING MEN'S HEALTH\n\nSo install Dr. Kegel now - it can be your best decision this year!\n\nAll features require an active subscription.\n\nThe Dr. Kegel App and its associated content are for informational and educational purposes only. Dr. Kegel is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The use of this app does not establish a doctor-patient or any other professional healthcare relationship.

      "description": "SMART THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES\n\n\nDario makes monitoring blood glucose easy thanks to the small size of its medical device. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System combines the meter, lancet, and a pack of 25 test strips in a unit so small, it can fit in your pocket. This makes it easy to keep with you, whether at home or on the go. With Dario, checking your blood glucose is quick, easy, and discreet, one drop at a time. It’s an all-in-one diabetes tracker.\n \nNOW SUPPORTING BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nDario is more than just a diabetes tracker for monitoring blood glucose. The app also pairs with the Dario Blood Pressure Monitoring System to record and store blood pressure measurements in the same logbook where you track blood glucose. This gives you a more complete perspective of your health. Track these two medical conditions together to learn more about your health for better conversations with your doctor, and to help you live better every day.\n\nWHAT MAKES DARIO DIFFERENT?\n\nDario was designed with convenience in mind, to make it easier to see your medical trends and help build healthy new habits according to your results. With insights gained through the Dario app, you may learn which foods and activities lead to better results. You may see how following a treatment plan improves your blood pressure results. Getting this positive reinforcement in real-time can be a powerful motivator! One drop is all it takes to see where you stand with this innovative diabetes tracker.\n \nKEEP YOUR DOCTOR & LOVED ONES IN THE LOOP\n\nKeep your medical care providers and family members up to date on your diabetic measurements. You can share all the data and logbooks inside the Dario application with anyone you like. Simply tap the share icon and select a contact from your address book to share your data instantly.\n \nCOUNT CARBS & TRACK ACTIVITY\n\nAny diabetic knows how challenging it can be to keep track of carbohydrate intake. Dario does the math for you. Simply tag which foods you ate, and Dario will automatically calculate how many carbs that gave you. With time, you may even start spotting patterns between the foods you’ve eaten and your blood glucose results and learn how to choose foods that your body responds to better. The same goes for activity. With Dario, you can keep track of your daily exercise (even washing the dishes!) and see if it influences your blood glucose levels. The results of this diabetes tracker may surprise you!\n \nHOW ACCURATE IS DARIO?\n\nDario has been tested extensively to ensure it meets FDA guidance for accuracy, that 95% of measurements are within ±15% of a true lab-tested value. This means you can be assured that the Dario meter will provide results you can trust. Dario has also presented several studies to the ADA, demonstrating how its system can help improve life for people living with diabetes.\n \nHYPO ALERT SYSTEM WITH GPS LOCATOR\n\nHypo alerts may save your life! If you have diabetes and have suffered from hypo events in the past, or have a child with diabetes, Dario's hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind. Simply connect the Dario meter to your smartphone, and upon recording a dangerously low glucose reading in one drop of blood, the Dario app will prepare a complete text message, including current blood glucose level and GPS location, to send to up to 4 emergency contacts. Because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence. And you may not feel well enough to describe your situation. Dario is here to keep you safe.\n\n\nThe information provided is not intended to be used for medical diagnosis or treatment or as a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult your physician or qualified health provider regarding your condition and appropriate medical treatment. Individual symptoms, situations, and circumstances may vary.\n\n Dario integrates with the Apple HeatlhKit, so your exercise, nutrition, and health data are recorded in one easy-to-access location.",

        "description": "SMART THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES\n\n\nDario makes monitoring blood glucose easy thanks to the small size of its medical device. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System combines the meter, lancet, and a pack of 25 test strips in a unit so small, it can fit in your pocket. This makes it easy to keep with you, whether at home or on the go. With Dario, checking your blood glucose is quick, easy, and discreet, one drop at a time. It’s an all-in-one diabetes tracker.\n \nNOW SUPPORTING BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nDario is more than just a diabetes tracker for monitoring blood glucose. The app also pairs with the Dario Blood Pressure Monitoring System to record and store blood pressure measurements in the same logbook where you track blood glucose. This gives you a more complete perspective of your health. Track these two medical conditions together to learn more about your health for better conversations with your doctor, and to help you live better every day.\n\nWHAT MAKES DARIO DIFFERENT?\n\nDario was designed with convenience in mind, to make it easier to see your medical trends and help build healthy new habits according to your results. With insights gained through the Dario app, you may learn which foods and activities lead to better results. You may see how following a treatment plan improves your blood pressure results. Getting this positive reinforcement in real-time can be a powerful motivator! One drop is all it takes to see where you stand with this innovative diabetes tracker.\n \nKEEP YOUR DOCTOR & LOVED ONES IN THE LOOP\n\nKeep your medical care providers and family members up to date on your diabetic measurements. You can share all the data and logbooks inside the Dario application with anyone you like. Simply tap the share icon and select a contact from your address book to share your data instantly.\n \nCOUNT CARBS & TRACK ACTIVITY\n\nAny diabetic knows how challenging it can be to keep track of carbohydrate intake. Dario does the math for you. Simply tag which foods you ate, and Dario will automatically calculate how many carbs that gave you. With time, you may even start spotting patterns between the foods you’ve eaten and your blood glucose results and learn how to choose foods that your body responds to better. The same goes for activity. With Dario, you can keep track of your daily exercise (even washing the dishes!) and see if it influences your blood glucose levels. The results of this diabetes tracker may surprise you!\n \nHOW ACCURATE IS DARIO?\n\nDario has been tested extensively to ensure it meets FDA guidance for accuracy, that 95% of measurements are within ±15% of a true lab-tested value. This means you can be assured that the Dario meter will provide results you can trust. Dario has also presented several studies to the ADA, demonstrating how its system can help improve life for people living with diabetes.\n \nHYPO ALERT SYSTEM WITH GPS LOCATOR\n\nHypo alerts may save your life! If you have diabetes and have suffered from hypo events in the past, or have a child with diabetes, Dario's hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind. Simply connect the Dario meter to your smartphone, and upon recording a dangerously low glucose reading in one drop of blood, the Dario app will prepare a complete text message, including current blood glucose level and GPS location, to send to up to 4 emergency contacts. Because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence. And you may not feel well enough to describe your situation. Dario is here to keep you safe.\n\n\nThe information provided is not intended to be used for medical diagnosis or treatment or as a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult your physician or qualified health provider regarding your condition and appropriate medical treatment. Individual symptoms, situations, and circumstances may vary.\n\n Dario integrates with the Apple HeatlhKit, so your exercise, nutrition, and health data are recorded in one easy-to-access location.",
