      "description": "The in-depth meteorological reasoning and details behind your local weather forecast, straight from the experts at NOAA/NWS.\n\nDeep Weather provides the deep, detailed meteorological reasoning behind your forecast, along with the various factors that are likely to influence it. Knowing this deeper weather information arms you with the knowledge to anticipate weather changes and adjust your plans accordingly.\n\nDeep Weather respects your privacy. Deep Weather doesn't track or store your location information, or any other data about you. (See privacy disclosure below). Deep Weather has no ads that distract and clutter up your weather information. Rather it relies on optional Pro subscriptions from our loyal users to pay the bills.\n\nDeep Weather provides you with a deeper understanding of your weather forecast by giving you weather details not commonly found in other apps in a convenient, easy-to-read package. \n\nDeep Weather automatically compiles an easy-to-read version of the most recent National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussion, advisories and warnings for your location. \n\nThe National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussions provide detailed information and background about the weather patterns and observations that are part of the most recent forecast model. They represent the \"Story behind the weather story,\" a glimpse behind the scenes of your current forecast, and provide lots of weather forecast detail not found anywhere else.\n\nIncluded sections:\nAviation Weather\nFire Weather\nClimatology\nMarine Weather\nBeach Forecast\nWatches, Warnings\nShort Term Forecast\nLong Term Forecast\n\nTo help provide a more visual picture, Deep Weather also provides easy access to a curated list of the most up-to-date weather graphics: National Forecast Chart, Surface Analysis, IR Satellite, Current Radar, Pacific and Atlantic Ocean surface analysis, 500mb graphical forecasts and more.\n\nFor Pro subscribers/owners, Deep Weather includes live animated radar rendered from National Weather Service source data.\n\nIn addition, Deep Weather provides localized 7-day extended forecasts from the National Weather Service for any location in the United States and its territories.\n\nDeep Weather provides great value in helping you anticipate and adjust to changes in the weather that you might not have been aware of if limited to other weather sources. By understanding the factors and assumptions that are part of the official forecast and how changes in those factors could affect the outcome, you are armed with a much deeper and more flexible understanding of the weather around you. This is highly valuable in aviation, sailing, long distance hiking and any other outdoor endeavor where changes in the weather can have great impact.\n\nUse the map view to select any National Weather Service Forecast Office and receive the latest forecast discussion for that area. \n\nThe discussion is broken up into sections for you, and the text itself formatted in a much more easily read format than the raw original.\n\nThese discussions and weather graphics are amended and updated several times per day, so you can follow how the weather forecast is changing in real time, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the thought that goes into forming the forecast.\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.rateofclimb.com/deepweather_privacy.html\nEULA/Terms of Use: http://www.rateofclimb.com/deepweather_terms.html",

        "description": "The in-depth meteorological reasoning and details behind your local weather forecast, straight from the experts at NOAA/NWS.\n\nDeep Weather provides the deep, detailed meteorological reasoning behind your forecast, along with the various factors that are likely to influence it. Knowing this deeper weather information arms you with the knowledge to anticipate weather changes and adjust your plans accordingly.\n\nDeep Weather respects your privacy. Deep Weather doesn't track or store your location information, or any other data about you. (See privacy disclosure below). Deep Weather has no ads that distract and clutter up your weather information. Rather it relies on optional Pro subscriptions from our loyal users to pay the bills.\n\nDeep Weather provides you with a deeper understanding of your weather forecast by giving you weather details not commonly found in other apps in a convenient, easy-to-read package. \n\nDeep Weather automatically compiles an easy-to-read version of the most recent National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussion, advisories and warnings for your location. \n\nThe National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussions provide detailed information and background about the weather patterns and observations that are part of the most recent forecast model. They represent the \"Story behind the weather story,\" a glimpse behind the scenes of your current forecast, and provide lots of weather forecast detail not found anywhere else.\n\nIncluded sections:\nAviation Weather\nFire Weather\nClimatology\nMarine Weather\nBeach Forecast\nWatches, Warnings\nShort Term Forecast\nLong Term Forecast\n\nTo help provide a more visual picture, Deep Weather also provides easy access to a curated list of the most up-to-date weather graphics: National Forecast Chart, Surface Analysis, IR Satellite, Current Radar, Pacific and Atlantic Ocean surface analysis, 500mb graphical forecasts and more.\n\nFor Pro subscribers/owners, Deep Weather includes live animated radar rendered from National Weather Service source data.\n\nIn addition, Deep Weather provides localized 7-day extended forecasts from the National Weather Service for any location in the United States and its territories.\n\nDeep Weather provides great value in helping you anticipate and adjust to changes in the weather that you might not have been aware of if limited to other weather sources. By understanding the factors and assumptions that are part of the official forecast and how changes in those factors could affect the outcome, you are armed with a much deeper and more flexible understanding of the weather around you. This is highly valuable in aviation, sailing, long distance hiking and any other outdoor endeavor where changes in the weather can have great impact.\n\nUse the map view to select any National Weather Service Forecast Office and receive the latest forecast discussion for that area. \n\nThe discussion is broken up into sections for you, and the text itself formatted in a much more easily read format than the raw original.\n\nThese discussions and weather graphics are amended and updated several times per day, so you can follow how the weather forecast is changing in real time, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the thought that goes into forming the forecast.\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.rateofclimb.com/deepweather_privacy.html\nEULA/Terms of Use: http://www.rateofclimb.com/deepweather_terms.html",

In your car. On your phone.\n\nIt's real-time. With up-to-the-minute weather updates including the latest watches, warnings, advisories, and bulletins. We alert you with relevant weather notifications to keep you informed.\n\nIt's real people, not voice simulation: Select your favorite weather talent, and they provide real-time weather reports on demand.\n\nIt's accurate and personalized for your location.\n\nThe technology is new, but the Weatherology team has been around for 34 years. We have contributed to more award-winning local weather broadcasts than our largest competitors combined.\n\nApple CarPlay audio apps must be voice-activated and offer audio capabilities only, which is exactly what our app does. With the exception of navigation apps, content such as weather maps and radar are currently prohibited from being displayed as content on the dashboard. We are fo­cused on cre­at­ing the best hands-free audio ex­pe­ri­ence in ve­hi­cles in ac­cor­dance with Apple Car­Play guide­lines.\n\nAlthough our expertise is audio, we are meteorologists, so we offer all the tools you need to stay informed. Up-to-the-minute radar that loads quickly and zooms in to your specific location. Storm vectors that illustrate current storm location and storm movement.\n\nWe offer current weather advisory graphics with up-to-the-minute audio weather details for each bulletin.\n\nHourly and 7-day forecast displays.\n\nWeather conditions from around the world.\n\nBeautiful weather widgets with an elegant, accurate and aesthetically pleasing Apple Watch interface.\n\nWith Apple CarPlay, Weatherology provides a hands-free, safe way to get the latest weather in your car.\n\nAt home, have a real meteorologist provide your forecast with details for your location unmatched by synthetic voices currently available through Smart Speakers.\n\nAutomobile safety is priority number one and our app is the only weather app that discourages distractions in your vehicle.",

      "description": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar’s Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms",

        "description": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar’s Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms",

      "description": "INTERACTIVE WEATHER MAP\n\nZoom Earth is an interactive weather map of the world and a real-time hurricane tracker.\n\nExplore the current weather and see forecasts for your location through interactive weather maps of rain, wind, temperature, pressure, and more.\n\nWith Zoom Earth, you can track the development of hurricanes, storms, and severe weather, monitor wildfires and smoke, and stay aware of the latest conditions by viewing satellite imagery updated in near real‑time.\n\n\n\nSATELLITE IMAGERY\n\nZoom Earth shows weather maps with near real-time satellite imagery. Images are updated every 10 minutes, with a delay between 20 and 40 minutes.\n\nLive satellite images are updated every 10 minutes from NOAA GOES and JMA Himawari geostationary satellites. EUMETSAT Meteosat images are updated every 15 minutes.\n\nHD satellite images are updated twice a day from NASA polar-orbiting satellites Aqua and Terra.\n\n\n\nWEATHER FORECAST MAPS\n\nExplore beautiful, interactive visualizations of the weather with our stunning global forecast maps. Our maps are continually updated with the latest weather forecast model data from DWD ICON and NOAA/NCEP/NWS GFS. Weather forecast maps include:\n\nPrecipitation Forecast - Rain, snow, and cloud cover, all in one map.\n\nWind Speed Forecast - Average speed and direction of surface winds.\n\nWind Gusts Forecast - Maximum speed of sudden bursts of wind.\n\nTemperature Forecast - Air temperatures at 2 meters (6 feet) above the ground.\n\n\"Feels Like\" Temperature Forecast - Perceived temperatures, also known as apparent temperature or heat index.\n\nRelative Humidity Forecast - How air moisture compares to temperature.\n\nDew Point Forecast - How dry or humid the air feels, and the point at which condensation occurs.\n\nAtmospheric Pressure Forecast - The average atmospheric pressure at sea level. Low-pressure areas often bring cloudy and windy weather. High-pressure areas are associated with clear skies and lighter winds.\n\n\n\nHURRICANE TRACKING\n\nFollow hurricanes from development to category 5 in real-time with our best-in-class tropical tracking system. Information is clear and easy to understand. Our hurricane tracking weather maps are updated using the very latest data from NHC, JTWC, NRL, and IBTrACS.\n\n\n\nWILDFIRE TRACKING\n\nMonitor wildfires with our active fires and heat spots overlay, which shows points of very high temperature detected by satellite. Detections are updated daily with data from NASA FIRMS. Use in conjunction with our GeoColor satellite imagery to see the movement of wildfire smoke and monitor fire weather in near real-time.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nAdjust temperature units, wind units, time zone, animation styles, and many more features with our comprehensive settings.\n\n\n\nZOOM EARTH PRO\n\nMore features are available through auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period and be charged within 24 hours, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

        "description": "INTERACTIVE WEATHER MAP\n\nZoom Earth is an interactive weather map of the world and a real-time hurricane tracker.\n\nExplore the current weather and see forecasts for your location through interactive weather maps of rain, wind, temperature, pressure, and more.\n\nWith Zoom Earth, you can track the development of hurricanes, storms, and severe weather, monitor wildfires and smoke, and stay aware of the latest conditions by viewing satellite imagery updated in near real‑time.\n\n\n\nSATELLITE IMAGERY\n\nZoom Earth shows weather maps with near real-time satellite imagery. Images are updated every 10 minutes, with a delay between 20 and 40 minutes.\n\nLive satellite images are updated every 10 minutes from NOAA GOES and JMA Himawari geostationary satellites. EUMETSAT Meteosat images are updated every 15 minutes.\n\nHD satellite images are updated twice a day from NASA polar-orbiting satellites Aqua and Terra.\n\n\n\nWEATHER FORECAST MAPS\n\nExplore beautiful, interactive visualizations of the weather with our stunning global forecast maps. Our maps are continually updated with the latest weather forecast model data from DWD ICON and NOAA/NCEP/NWS GFS. Weather forecast maps include:\n\nPrecipitation Forecast - Rain, snow, and cloud cover, all in one map.\n\nWind Speed Forecast - Average speed and direction of surface winds.\n\nWind Gusts Forecast - Maximum speed of sudden bursts of wind.\n\nTemperature Forecast - Air temperatures at 2 meters (6 feet) above the ground.\n\n\"Feels Like\" Temperature Forecast - Perceived temperatures, also known as apparent temperature or heat index.\n\nRelative Humidity Forecast - How air moisture compares to temperature.\n\nDew Point Forecast - How dry or humid the air feels, and the point at which condensation occurs.\n\nAtmospheric Pressure Forecast - The average atmospheric pressure at sea level. Low-pressure areas often bring cloudy and windy weather. High-pressure areas are associated with clear skies and lighter winds.\n\n\n\nHURRICANE TRACKING\n\nFollow hurricanes from development to category 5 in real-time with our best-in-class tropical tracking system. Information is clear and easy to understand. Our hurricane tracking weather maps are updated using the very latest data from NHC, JTWC, NRL, and IBTrACS.\n\n\n\nWILDFIRE TRACKING\n\nMonitor wildfires with our active fires and heat spots overlay, which shows points of very high temperature detected by satellite. Detections are updated daily with data from NASA FIRMS. Use in conjunction with our GeoColor satellite imagery to see the movement of wildfire smoke and monitor fire weather in near real-time.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nAdjust temperature units, wind units, time zone, animation styles, and many more features with our comprehensive settings.\n\n\n\nZOOM EARTH PRO\n\nMore features are available through auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period and be charged within 24 hours, unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

      "description": "Chief Meteorologist Brad Nitz and Severe Weather Team 2 have made the most accurate local weather app, “The WSBTV Weather App,” even better. \n\nAtlanta’s most powerful weather app includes the following:\n \n- There is a new radar in the weather app that matches the radar found on other digital platforms and also includes future radar to provide you with a likely path and outlook of storms. The radar has 250-meter resolution, the highest available.\n- New alert types - We added earthquakes and storm tracks as layers in the radar. Now you can track the location and magnitude of earthquakes as well for storms the speed, direction and type. Tap the “storm symbols” icon in the radar to see the list.\n- Push alerts are FREE for more than 25 alert types including everything from tornado warnings to winter storm warnings and tropical storm alert types.\n- Now you can scroll through the home screen to access most of what you need or want on one tab.\n- Locally crafted forecasts - Select a location inside the Atlanta market to see a local forecast created by WSB’s local weather experts. The app also tells you which member of Severe Weather Team 2 crafted the local forecast. National applications that come pre-loaded on your phone don’t have local experts focused solely on getting the local forecast right every day.\n- Place a location pin precisely where you want it for a specific address or any position on a map. When saving a location you can name it exactly how you want it.\n- The app works with identical features on tablet and handset.\n \nThe WSBTV Weather App also has these critical benefits and features:\n\n- The app is constantly updated with the latest area storm and forecast information and includes Severe Weather Team 2’s 5-day Forecast with the “Weekend Always in View.”\n- Live Stormtracker 2HD Radar zooms down to your neighborhood or zooms out to check radar anywhere in the country.\n- It provides Location-Based Storm Alerts. While many other apps offer alerts based on your county, The WSBTV Weather App supports a more precise type of alert issued for the most dangerous types of weather threats. More precision means you get alerts that matter to you, not false alarms.\n- Current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts for any location you enter.\n- Level 3 interactive radar, animation/loops and visible satellite map\n- Additional items added seasonally\n- High resolution satellite cloud imagery\n- Daily and Hourly forecasts updated hourly\n- Ability to add and save locations\n- A fully integrated GPS for current location awareness\n \n*Data and alerting available for the United States only.",

        "description": "Chief Meteorologist Brad Nitz and Severe Weather Team 2 have made the most accurate local weather app, “The WSBTV Weather App,” even better. \n\nAtlanta’s most powerful weather app includes the following:\n \n- There is a new radar in the weather app that matches the radar found on other digital platforms and also includes future radar to provide you with a likely path and outlook of storms. The radar has 250-meter resolution, the highest available.\n- New alert types - We added earthquakes and storm tracks as layers in the radar. Now you can track the location and magnitude of earthquakes as well for storms the speed, direction and type. Tap the “storm symbols” icon in the radar to see the list.\n- Push alerts are FREE for more than 25 alert types including everything from tornado warnings to winter storm warnings and tropical storm alert types.\n- Now you can scroll through the home screen to access most of what you need or want on one tab.\n- Locally crafted forecasts - Select a location inside the Atlanta market to see a local forecast created by WSB’s local weather experts. The app also tells you which member of Severe Weather Team 2 crafted the local forecast. National applications that come pre-loaded on your phone don’t have local experts focused solely on getting the local forecast right every day.\n- Place a location pin precisely where you want it for a specific address or any position on a map. When saving a location you can name it exactly how you want it.\n- The app works with identical features on tablet and handset.\n \nThe WSBTV Weather App also has these critical benefits and features:\n\n- The app is constantly updated with the latest area storm and forecast information and includes Severe Weather Team 2’s 5-day Forecast with the “Weekend Always in View.”\n- Live Stormtracker 2HD Radar zooms down to your neighborhood or zooms out to check radar anywhere in the country.\n- It provides Location-Based Storm Alerts. While many other apps offer alerts based on your county, The WSBTV Weather App supports a more precise type of alert issued for the most dangerous types of weather threats. More precision means you get alerts that matter to you, not false alarms.\n- Current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts for any location you enter.\n- Level 3 interactive radar, animation/loops and visible satellite map\n- Additional items added seasonally\n- High resolution satellite cloud imagery\n- Daily and Hourly forecasts updated hourly\n- Ability to add and save locations\n- A fully integrated GPS for current location awareness\n \n*Data and alerting available for the United States only.",
