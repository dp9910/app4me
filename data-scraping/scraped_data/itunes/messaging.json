      "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

And if it DOES happen again, the app will clear any unnecessary notifications on the next Discord app launch.\n\nThe following issues have also been cleaned up: \n\n- Sharing multiple images to Discord via the Share Sheet should now preserve the order of images properly. \n\n- Fixed multi-image embeds only showing the last image, as if you only heard a joke’s punchline before the rest of it. \n\n- Resolved an issue where the Camera Flip button wouldn’t function properly... although it still doesn’t make your phone do a backflip. \n\nAs always, see what else we’ve been cookin’ (or, I guess, uncooked?) over at dis.gd/PatchNotes",

      "description": "Speak freely with Confide. With our encrypted messenger app, your mobile communications will be completely confidential and have the same level of privacy as the spoken word.\n\nYou’ll leave zero trace online with end-to-end encrypted messaging, vanishing messages, screenshot-proof technology, and Incognito Mode. You can even send retractable messages or use our line-by-line text reader.\n\nOver 350 million encrypted messages have already been delivered safely and self-destructed with the help of Confide, while the patented ScreenshieldKit technology prevented more than 7.9K screenshot attempts.\n\nHere's what you get with Confide:\n \nENCRYPTED MESSAGING\nSend private texts and sensitive data with end-to-end encryption. (Your data is never saved on our servers.)\n\nDISAPPEARING MESSAGES\nTurn on Confidential Mode, and your messages will disappear after they’re read. Want to keep them for the day? Turn off Confidential Mode. Regardless, all messages will disappear automatically 24 hours after being sent. \n\nVANISHING iMESSAGES \nConfide’s highly-rated iMessage plugin does what no other technology can: erases your iMessages during any conversation. With Confide, you can compose and send self-destructive messages via iMessage.\n\nSCREENSHOT PREVENTION\nConfide’s patented technology ensures messages cannot be screenshotted by their recipients. Passports, credit cards, personal docs, and sensitive messages stay protected.\n \nPRIVATE AND GROUP MESSAGING\nEnjoy all of the privacy perks of this secret text app, like anonymous text, safe chat, and private texting – whether you’re 1-to-1 messaging or using group chat.\n \nTHREADED CONVERSATIONS\nAdd a layer of security to group texts. Quickly start a thread within the chat experience to keep the momentum going – without disrupting an ongoing group chat conversation.\n\nINCOGNITO MODE\nStay anonymous. Unlike other encrypted messenger apps that announce when a new user has joined, Incognito Mode ensures you become undiscoverable to the people you don’t want to be seen by.\n\nRETRACT UNREAD MESSAGES\nMake private messaging even more private with the option to unsend unread messages. Change your mind? Retract!\n \nADDITIONAL FEATURES:\n* Create nicknames for your contacts\n* Switch themes \n\nAVAILABLE ON MOBILE AND DESKTOP\nUse an anonymous chat, encrypted messaging, safe chat, private text, and Confide’s other features on the go or closer or on your computer.\n\nEveryone deserves their privacy. Confide is perfect for professionals in the financial, political, journalism, and legal fields – because conversations are safe, and they don’t leave a paper trail. \n \nThe Confide app has been used by thousands of people around the globe and been featured by The New York Times, TechCrunch, and many more. Join the Confide community today!  \n \nSubscribe to Premium to access all the features of the secret text app.\n\n* Subscription payments will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of your purchase.\n\n* Subscriptions will automatically renew and payment will be charged to your iTunes account unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. The cost of the renewal depends on your Subscription Plan.\nOur standard Subscription Plans are:\n* 1-Year Subscription with a 7-day free trial\n* 1-Month Subscription with a 7-day trial\n\n* Subscription with a free trial period will automatically renew to a paid subscription.

        "description": "Speak freely with Confide. With our encrypted messenger app, your mobile communications will be completely confidential and have the same level of privacy as the spoken word.\n\nYou’ll leave zero trace online with end-to-end encrypted messaging, vanishing messages, screenshot-proof technology, and Incognito Mode. You can even send retractable messages or use our line-by-line text reader.\n\nOver 350 million encrypted messages have already been delivered safely and self-destructed with the help of Confide, while the patented ScreenshieldKit technology prevented more than 7.9K screenshot attempts.\n\nHere's what you get with Confide:\n \nENCRYPTED MESSAGING\nSend private texts and sensitive data with end-to-end encryption. (Your data is never saved on our servers.)\n\nDISAPPEARING MESSAGES\nTurn on Confidential Mode, and your messages will disappear after they’re read. Want to keep them for the day? Turn off Confidential Mode. Regardless, all messages will disappear automatically 24 hours after being sent. \n\nVANISHING iMESSAGES \nConfide’s highly-rated iMessage plugin does what no other technology can: erases your iMessages during any conversation. With Confide, you can compose and send self-destructive messages via iMessage.\n\nSCREENSHOT PREVENTION\nConfide’s patented technology ensures messages cannot be screenshotted by their recipients. Passports, credit cards, personal docs, and sensitive messages stay protected.\n \nPRIVATE AND GROUP MESSAGING\nEnjoy all of the privacy perks of this secret text app, like anonymous text, safe chat, and private texting – whether you’re 1-to-1 messaging or using group chat.\n \nTHREADED CONVERSATIONS\nAdd a layer of security to group texts. Quickly start a thread within the chat experience to keep the momentum going – without disrupting an ongoing group chat conversation.\n\nINCOGNITO MODE\nStay anonymous. Unlike other encrypted messenger apps that announce when a new user has joined, Incognito Mode ensures you become undiscoverable to the people you don’t want to be seen by.\n\nRETRACT UNREAD MESSAGES\nMake private messaging even more private with the option to unsend unread messages. Change your mind? Retract!\n \nADDITIONAL FEATURES:\n* Create nicknames for your contacts\n* Switch themes \n\nAVAILABLE ON MOBILE AND DESKTOP\nUse an anonymous chat, encrypted messaging, safe chat, private text, and Confide’s other features on the go or closer or on your computer.\n\nEveryone deserves their privacy. Confide is perfect for professionals in the financial, political, journalism, and legal fields – because conversations are safe, and they don’t leave a paper trail. \n \nThe Confide app has been used by thousands of people around the globe and been featured by The New York Times, TechCrunch, and many more. Join the Confide community today!  \n \nSubscribe to Premium to access all the features of the secret text app.\n\n* Subscription payments will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of your purchase.\n\n* Subscriptions will automatically renew and payment will be charged to your iTunes account unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

      "description": "Ease allows patients to invite family members and loved ones to receive text, photo and video updates on their status throughout the hospital experience in a safe and secure app. A HIPAA compliant communication app, Ease is designed to improve patient satisfaction and increase transparency with updates used to educate and inform families on the patient’s status. Family members and loved ones will be able to view all Ease updates for 60 seconds of screen time before it disappears, and all content is never stored on a device. Improving patient satisfaction, communication and reducing anxiety has never been easier.

Create and reuse messages!\n- Advanced settings for contacts and groups management!\n- Support for multiple image attachments!\n- Use multiple messaging services at once!\n- Includes birthday reminders!\n- Messages scheduler for later delivery! (via notifications)\n- Reach multiple recipient types (with different contact info on the address book) at once:\nYou can write just 1 message and send it to a group or individuals, even if some are email contacts, other phone numbers, both, etc, depending on the app settings. \nJust select \"Use both services\" on the app settings and the app will know how to reach them all.\n\n- Import of iCloud groups\n- Dark mode support\n- Unlimited messages *\n- Quick recipients selection mode and group management \n- Easily create/update/delete contacts, groups and template messages\n- Useful help tooltips\n- Available FAQ & Video Tutorial (English only)\n\n----------------------------- HOW IT WORKS----------------------------------\nSend messages to groups or everyone you know, typing the message just once.\nReach all your contacts by Email, SMS/MMS/iMessage, and/or post to social networks (Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn) at the same time, at once. No need to write separate messages or use different software/media.  Just confirm and send!\nUse built-in common messages or create custom ones. Archive them for future usage if you're lazy. \nManage your contacts and create custom groups to speedup messaging.  \nEasy Message is even clever enough to know how each contact should be reached\nAdd recipients to you message just by selecting them\nCreate new groups or update existing ones, just by selecting multiple contacts\n\n----------------------- REQUIREMENTS ----------------------\n\nThis app requires IOS 9 or later.\n\n------------------------- NOTES -------------------------------\n\nNote: On iPad you can only send messages via Email or iMessage (since SMS/MMS is not available on iPad devices due to the lack of a SIM card)\n\n* On phones, if you want undisclosed recipients and not a group text you must use plain SMS (these services must be configured on your phone Settings -> Messages). When doing this, remember that some mobile operators might limit the number of your recipients, and having too many recipients may cause failure in your recipients receiving your messages. In addition, always make sure your selected recipients have valid phone numbers. \n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ (English only) available here: https://pcdreamsapps.wixsite.com/easymessage/faq\n\nGood looking icons by:\nGlyphish,  glyphish.com\nCrazEriC, http://crazeric.deviantart.com/\nLenka Meleakova, http://www.profimagazin.cz\nVisual Pharm, http://www.visualpharm.com\nZen Nikki - http://zen-nikki.deviantart.com/",

        "description": "Easy Message LITE - Mass text And Bulk Group Messaging! \n\nMass Email, SMS and Social Media in just one app, with just one message!\n\n------------------------- KEY FEATURES ----------------------------------\n- Powerful marketing tool for business or personal usage\n- One text message for all recipient types.

Create and reuse messages!\n- Advanced settings for contacts and groups management!\n- Support for multiple image attachments!\n- Use multiple messaging services at once!\n- Includes birthday reminders!\n- Messages scheduler for later delivery! (via notifications)\n- Reach multiple recipient types (with different contact info on the address book) at once:\nYou can write just 1 message and send it to a group or individuals, even if some are email contacts, other phone numbers, both, etc, depending on the app settings. \nJust select \"Use both services\" on the app settings and the app will know how to reach them all.\n\n- Import of iCloud groups\n- Dark mode support\n- Unlimited messages *\n- Quick recipients selection mode and group management \n- Easily create/update/delete contacts, groups and template messages\n- Useful help tooltips\n- Available FAQ & Video Tutorial (English only)\n\n----------------------------- HOW IT WORKS----------------------------------\nSend messages to groups or everyone you know, typing the message just once.\nReach all your contacts by Email, SMS/MMS/iMessage, and/or post to social networks (Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn) at the same time, at once. No need to write separate messages or use different software/media.  Just confirm and send!\nUse built-in common messages or create custom ones. Archive them for future usage if you're lazy. \nManage your contacts and create custom groups to speedup messaging.  \nEasy Message is even clever enough to know how each contact should be reached\nAdd recipients to you message just by selecting them\nCreate new groups or update existing ones, just by selecting multiple contacts\n\n----------------------- REQUIREMENTS ----------------------\n\nThis app requires IOS 9 or later.\n\n------------------------- NOTES -------------------------------\n\nNote: On iPad you can only send messages via Email or iMessage (since SMS/MMS is not available on iPad devices due to the lack of a SIM card)\n\n* On phones, if you want undisclosed recipients and not a group text you must use plain SMS (these services must be configured on your phone Settings -> Messages). When doing this, remember that some mobile operators might limit the number of your recipients, and having too many recipients may cause failure in your recipients receiving your messages. In addition, always make sure your selected recipients have valid phone numbers. \n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ (English only) available here: https://pcdreamsapps.wixsite.com/easymessage/faq\n\nGood looking icons by:\nGlyphish,  glyphish.com\nCrazEriC, http://crazeric.deviantart.com/\nLenka Meleakova, http://www.profimagazin.cz\nVisual Pharm, http://www.visualpharm.com\nZen Nikki - http://zen-nikki.deviantart.com/",

      "description": "Kyew lets you write & schedule text messages to send later.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n1. Install this app\n2. Compose a new message\n3. Attach relevant photos, videos, or files\n4. Set the due date\n5. You'll get notified, press send, done.\n\nKyew (pronounced \"Q\" as in cue) will save your message, including any attachments, and send you a notification at the scheduled time. Upon opening the notification, your pre-composed message will be ready to send in one tap. \n\nYou can set up a recurring schedule to send text messages daily,  weekly, monthly, or yearly. This is ideal for both personal and business use.\n\n\nGROUP TEXT & MASS MESSAGES\n\nSend individual text messages to multiple people. You can create and manage groups within the app, or import from your contacts. This is a terrific function that allows you to write a message once and dispatch it to an entire group individually without creating a group chat. It's similar to BCC'ing a group of contacts in an email.\n\n\nFOR PERSONAL USE\n\n* Birthdays & anniversaries\n* Remember important days\n* Stay in touch with old friends\n* Invitations\n* Count-down reminders (e.g. \"10 days until Hawaii\")\n* Etc.\n\n\nFOR BUSINESS USE\n\nDid you know that 98% of texts are opened, and most of them are read within 5 minutes? Texting is indispensable for your business, and Kyew is your trusted texting tool.\n\n* Appointment reminders\n* Renewal/Expiration notices\n* Follow-ups\n* Content-promotion\n* Customer-relationship management\n* Etc.\n\n\nKYEW PLUS\n\nThe app is free to use, but some functionality requires a subscription. See in-app for details.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.saturdaytechnologies.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.saturdaytechnologies.com/terms",

Set the due date\n5. You'll get notified, press send, done.\n\nKyew (pronounced \"Q\" as in cue) will save your message, including any attachments, and send you a notification at the scheduled time. Upon opening the notification, your pre-composed message will be ready to send in one tap. \n\nYou can set up a recurring schedule to send text messages daily,  weekly, monthly, or yearly. This is ideal for both personal and business use.\n\n\nGROUP TEXT & MASS MESSAGES\n\nSend individual text messages to multiple people. You can create and manage groups within the app, or import from your contacts. This is a terrific function that allows you to write a message once and dispatch it to an entire group individually without creating a group chat. It's similar to BCC'ing a group of contacts in an email.\n\n\nFOR PERSONAL USE\n\n* Birthdays & anniversaries\n* Remember important days\n* Stay in touch with old friends\n* Invitations\n* Count-down reminders (e.g. \"10 days until Hawaii\")\n* Etc.\n\n\nFOR BUSINESS USE\n\nDid you know that 98% of texts are opened, and most of them are read within 5 minutes? Texting is indispensable for your business, and Kyew is your trusted texting tool.\n\n* Appointment reminders\n* Renewal/Expiration notices\n* Follow-ups\n* Content-promotion\n* Customer-relationship management\n* Etc.\n\n\nKYEW PLUS\n\nThe app is free to use, but some functionality requires a subscription. See in-app for details.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.saturdaytechnologies.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.saturdaytechnologies.com/terms",

      "description": "Carrier is the best way to schedule messages.\n\n**Note:** For your privacy, it is not possible to send messages on your behalf without you taking action. You have to push send when you get the notification. Don't forget!\n\n## Why I created this\nAsking Siri to remind you to send someone a message only helps if you can remember what you wanted to say. After forgetting one too many times to send an important message, I decided to make an app to help me out. Now I can write and schedule the message when I think of it and send it at just the right time.\n\n## How it works\nJust as when sending a regular text message, you select a person and write your message. Then you choose the date and time for the message to send. When the time comes, you will get a notification that will allow you to send the message. It integrates with the built-in Messages app, so it comes from you in your normal conversations.\n\n## Contacts\nIf you choose to give Carrier access to your contacts, it is effortless to select a recipient for your message. Rest assured that your contacts are not harvested or shared with anyone—it just makes your life easier. If you do not give access, you can still select a recipient.\n\n## Groups\nWhen you choose multiple recipients for a message, you will be prompted to create a group to make it easier to message those people again. You can manage your groups in Settings at any time.\n\n## Dark theme\nA gorgeous dark theme makes writing and scheduling messages in low light easy on your eyes. And with automatic switching from light to dark themes, you can always have the best experience for the moment.\n\n## Pro upgrade\nCarrier is free to use for a limited number of messages each month. When you upgrade to Carrier Pro, you will unlock unlimited messages, the ability to use your voice to create and schedule messages, and help support continued development. Thanks!\n\n## Family project\nAs I have worked on this app, my kids have contributed lots of ideas for features. My eleven-year-old daughter thought of many of the Easter eggs, and hopes you will enjoy finding them.\n\nWe hope this will be as much help for you as it has been for us!\n-Ben",

        "description": "Carrier is the best way to schedule messages.\n\n**Note:** For your privacy, it is not possible to send messages on your behalf without you taking action. You have to push send when you get the notification. Don't forget!\n\n## Why I created this\nAsking Siri to remind you to send someone a message only helps if you can remember what you wanted to say. After forgetting one too many times to send an important message, I decided to make an app to help me out. Now I can write and schedule the message when I think of it and send it at just the right time.\n\n## How it works\nJust as when sending a regular text message, you select a person and write your message. Then you choose the date and time for the message to send. When the time comes, you will get a notification that will allow you to send the message. It integrates with the built-in Messages app, so it comes from you in your normal conversations.\n\n## Contacts\nIf you choose to give Carrier access to your contacts, it is effortless to select a recipient for your message. Rest assured that your contacts are not harvested or shared with anyone—it just makes your life easier. If you do not give access, you can still select a recipient.\n\n## Groups\nWhen you choose multiple recipients for a message, you will be prompted to create a group to make it easier to message those people again. You can manage your groups in Settings at any time.\n\n## Dark theme\nA gorgeous dark theme makes writing and scheduling messages in low light easy on your eyes. And with automatic switching from light to dark themes, you can always have the best experience for the moment.\n\n## Pro upgrade\nCarrier is free to use for a limited number of messages each month. When you upgrade to Carrier Pro, you will unlock unlimited messages, the ability to use your voice to create and schedule messages, and help support continued development. Thanks!\n\n## Family project\nAs I have worked on this app, my kids have contributed lots of ideas for features. My eleven-year-old daughter thought of many of the Easter eggs, and hopes you will enjoy finding them.\n\nWe hope this will be as much help for you as it has been for us!\n-Ben",

      "description": "Just another messaging app to clutter your app drawer, right? That's exactly what LiteWire is, and we don't even have degrees from MIT or Harvard like everyone else. But, we are the only messaging app that is as fun as we are safe. With just one gesture, you can delete any regretful text, or send a distress beacon that alerts your close contacts of your location and mic recordings of your surroundings. LiteWire will protect you from embarrassing decisions just as much as it will protect you from danger. Here’s a shortlist of our features:\n\n- Complete anonymity for sign up: no phone number, contacts, email address, last four of your social and credit card CVC code, blood type, etc. Just agree on a channel name or find each other by username.\n- Deleting messages deletes for all parties. This includes images and videos you send.\n- Custom watermarks protect your private content on your buddies’ devices, along with screenshot notifications\n- Distress beacon tells your close buddies your exact GPS coordinates and continual audio recordings of your surroundings.\n- End to end encryption, obviously. We can't read anything you send and don't want to. It's probably boring.\n- We are free! Other chat apps that offer similar features want your money. Gross.\n\nWe made this app so you are in complete control of your communications and feel safe, both in the cyber world and the real world. Protect your communications from ex’s, Apples, Googles, and governments with LiteWire, the ultimate app for sexting (safe texting).",

        "description": "Just another messaging app to clutter your app drawer, right? That's exactly what LiteWire is, and we don't even have degrees from MIT or Harvard like everyone else. But, we are the only messaging app that is as fun as we are safe. With just one gesture, you can delete any regretful text, or send a distress beacon that alerts your close contacts of your location and mic recordings of your surroundings. LiteWire will protect you from embarrassing decisions just as much as it will protect you from danger. Here’s a shortlist of our features:\n\n- Complete anonymity for sign up: no phone number, contacts, email address, last four of your social and credit card CVC code, blood type, etc. Just agree on a channel name or find each other by username.\n- Deleting messages deletes for all parties. This includes images and videos you send.\n- Custom watermarks protect your private content on your buddies’ devices, along with screenshot notifications\n- Distress beacon tells your close buddies your exact GPS coordinates and continual audio recordings of your surroundings.\n- End to end encryption, obviously. We can't read anything you send and don't want to. It's probably boring.\n- We are free! Other chat apps that offer similar features want your money. Gross.\n\nWe made this app so you are in complete control of your communications and feel safe, both in the cyber world and the real world. Protect your communications from ex’s, Apples, Googles, and governments with LiteWire, the ultimate app for sexting (safe texting).",

Share quick sketches, notes, photos, and even group messages that appear right on your friends’ home screens.\n\n-------\n\nDrawing\n\nChoose from different pen styles, thicknesses, and colors—or create your own custom colors and save them as presets. Add backgrounds, photos from your library or camera, text, and more. Save drafts to finish your creations later.\n\n-------\n\nFriends\n\nYour account starts as private so only friends can send you messages. Switch to public if you’d like anyone in the app to connect with you. Finding friends is simple—search nearby, sync your contacts, or share your invite code.\n\n-------\n\nGroups\n\nCreate groups to share doodles and messages between multiple friends all in one widget. Think of it as group chat, but more fun and visual.\n\n-------\n\nWidgets\n\nAdd multiple widgets to keep up with all your messages. Choose from:\n- Recent Messages: See the latest updates from friends and groups.\n- Friend Widget: View the most recent message from a specific friend.\n- Group Widget: View the most recent message from a group.",

Think of it as group chat, but more fun and visual.\n\n-------\n\nWidgets\n\nAdd multiple widgets to keep up with all your messages.

      "description": "We understand the importance of making personal connections and having real relationships. Project Broadcast allows you to reach more people in your network while maintaining that personal connection you know is important.  \n\nProject Broadcast allows you to manage your contacts as well as group them in any way you want using our innovative tagging strategy.  Tags can be long lasting mechanisms for grouping or a quick way to group that is temporary and easily removed.  You also have the ability to create and manage templates so that while building campaign messages, broadcasting to a group, or just replying to a message you can quickly leverage a template and prevent those duplicate messages we all hate sending over and over.  Our campaigns allow you to prepare messages that are delivered to your recipients automatically.  Joining a campaign can be done manually by you adding contacts or groups of contacts via tags to the campaign or you can leverage our keyword feature.  Keywords are simple, small, rememberable text words you can have people text to your Project Broadcast number that automates so much!  You can auto reply to a keyword (with optional delay).  You can auto tag contacts who text the keyword.  You can also have contacts who text the keyword be automatically placed in campaigns!  \n\nWith all the power of Project Broadcast we also know how important it is for you to share that creative spirit you use to create such engaging campaigns.  Because of that we also have a Bundles feature!  You can create a bundle and attach as many campaigns and templates as you like so you can share that bundle with another Project Broadcast user!  This lets your efforts scale to multiple users.\n\nNeed to quickly send a message to a group of contacts?  Easy!  With Project Broadcast you can Broadcast a message immediately or set it for a future time.  Your messages, campaigns, replies on keywords, etc can also leverage our cutting edge dynamic fields so your messages feel even more personal to the recipient.  Project Broadcast is the tool for the job when you want to have a real conversation with the recipient and you are hoping your broadcasted messages or campaigns create a dialogue with the recipients. \n\nWe are excited for you to use Project Broadcast!  #startBroadcasting",

        "description": "We understand the importance of making personal connections and having real relationships. Project Broadcast allows you to reach more people in your network while maintaining that personal connection you know is important.  \n\nProject Broadcast allows you to manage your contacts as well as group them in any way you want using our innovative tagging strategy.  Tags can be long lasting mechanisms for grouping or a quick way to group that is temporary and easily removed.  You also have the ability to create and manage templates so that while building campaign messages, broadcasting to a group, or just replying to a message you can quickly leverage a template and prevent those duplicate messages we all hate sending over and over.  Our campaigns allow you to prepare messages that are delivered to your recipients automatically.  Joining a campaign can be done manually by you adding contacts or groups of contacts via tags to the campaign or you can leverage our keyword feature.  Keywords are simple, small, rememberable text words you can have people text to your Project Broadcast number that automates so much!  You can auto reply to a keyword (with optional delay).  You can auto tag contacts who text the keyword.  You can also have contacts who text the keyword be automatically placed in campaigns!  \n\nWith all the power of Project Broadcast we also know how important it is for you to share that creative spirit you use to create such engaging campaigns.  Because of that we also have a Bundles feature!  You can create a bundle and attach as many campaigns and templates as you like so you can share that bundle with another Project Broadcast user!  This lets your efforts scale to multiple users.\n\nNeed to quickly send a message to a group of contacts?  Easy!  With Project Broadcast you can Broadcast a message immediately or set it for a future time.  Your messages, campaigns, replies on keywords, etc can also leverage our cutting edge dynamic fields so your messages feel even more personal to the recipient.  Project Broadcast is the tool for the job when you want to have a real conversation with the recipient and you are hoping your broadcasted messages or campaigns create a dialogue with the recipients. \n\nWe are excited for you to use Project Broadcast!  #startBroadcasting",

      "description": "We, humans, have natural ways to communicate. We say things to each other in private, then we forget over time. Yelling is here to do that digitally.\n\nYelling is fully encrypted end-to-end. All your messages, whether it's a 1:1 chat or a group chat, are fully encrypted in-transit or at rest.\n\nYelling does NOT store your messages, not on the server side, and not on the client side. You can choose to store messages for 1, 7 or 30 days. After which, the messages are gone. There are no permanent storage options.\n\nYelling does not store metadata.

      "description": "YEO is a next-generation secure, private messaging platform that authenticates not just the device, but the intended recipient using continuous facial recognition. So you can decide who views your content, as well as where and when they see it. \n\nToday, businesses and individuals are using private messaging more and more, but most popular messaging platforms do not meet compliance or legal requirements for business use… and though we rely on trust, we lose control of our content the moment we hit ‘send’. Until now....\n\nYEO Messaging is currently available for individual users who want to know that the messages, files and media they share are secure, private, and only being viewed by the intended recipient, whether that’s a private picture or sensitive documents. As well as end-to-end encryption and geofencing features, we’re the only app of our kind to use continuous facial recognition to verify not just the device, but the person looking at it. \n\nYEO Pro and YEO for Business will be launching soon - watch the space! \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Compliant and reliable security: YEO offers a real solution for businesses (and individuals) who want to reclaim control over their data.\n\n- Verify the person as well as the device: Continuous facial recognition authenticates the person looking at the device… so only the intended recipient can view your messages.\n\n- Geofence technology: Apply a geofence to your messages, allowing you to control where and when they are viewed.\n\n- Control over your content: Nothing can be downloaded, forwarded, screengrabbed or shown to anyone else without your permission. \n\n- Encryption, elevated: Encryption isn’t optional. We use cutting-edge end-to-end encryption technology to secure all messages from the moment they’re sent to the point that the recipient’s face has been verified. \n\nYEO (pronounced ‘Yo’, and an acronym for Your Eye Only) was founded by a team of technology, security and design specialists. Disturbed by the lack of trust in existing messaging platforms - particularly in a business setting -they developed their own, packed with features that place control into the hands of the user, and not the platform owner. \n\nYEO has not been designed to run properly on iPad. \n\nFor more information, see our Terms of Use https://yeomessaging.com/terms-of-use/ and Privacy Policy https://yeomessaging.com/privacy-policy/",

As well as end-to-end encryption and geofencing features, we’re the only app of our kind to use continuous facial recognition to verify not just the device, but the person looking at it. \n\nYEO Pro and YEO for Business will be launching soon - watch the space! \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Compliant and reliable security: YEO offers a real solution for businesses (and individuals) who want to reclaim control over their data.\n\n- Verify the person as well as the device: Continuous facial recognition authenticates the person looking at the device… so only the intended recipient can view your messages.\n\n- Geofence technology: Apply a geofence to your messages, allowing you to control where and when they are viewed.\n\n- Control over your content: Nothing can be downloaded, forwarded, screengrabbed or shown to anyone else without your permission. \n\n- Encryption, elevated: Encryption isn’t optional. We use cutting-edge end-to-end encryption technology to secure all messages from the moment they’re sent to the point that the recipient’s face has been verified. \n\nYEO (pronounced ‘Yo’, and an acronym for Your Eye Only) was founded by a team of technology, security and design specialists. Disturbed by the lack of trust in existing messaging platforms - particularly in a business setting -they developed their own, packed with features that place control into the hands of the user, and not the platform owner. \n\nYEO has not been designed to run properly on iPad. \n\nFor more information, see our Terms of Use https://yeomessaging.com/terms-of-use/ and Privacy Policy https://yeomessaging.com/privacy-policy/",

You can call or send messages, send photo and video messages as well as voice messages, locations and contacts worldwide over WiFi or 3G. AnyTalk seamlessly syncs across your devices and can be used on phones and tablets.\n\nCALLS AND VIDEO CALLS\nYou can now call any of your AnyTalk contacts for free, arrange group calls (for up to 4 people), including video calls, while being sure that all your data is secured with encryption. (iOS 8.1+)\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION AND PRIVACY\nAnyTalk is taking care about your convenience and privacy, so we sync chats history across your devices, but don’t store it on our servers. Your chats history is yours and no one else can read it.\n\nUSE DIFFERENT SIM CARDS\nAnyTalk give you ability to tie different phone numbers for the same account. This way you can insure yourself from losing access to the account when you lost sim-card, as well as freely use AnyTalk while you travel around the globe and use different sim cards.\n\nENCRYPTION\nYou can enable end-to-end encryption for both new or existing chats. When encryption is enabled, all outgoing messages will be encrypted by special key and only participants who got this key can read conversation. The key generates on device of user who initiate encryption and must be transferred to other chat participant by meeting in person. This way our servers knows nothing about your encryption key, plus you will avoid any possibility of man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nHIDDEN CHATS\nEncrypted chats will help you when it comes to data transfer and secure communication. But if someone get physical access to your mobile device — let’s say your friend, or mother, or girlfriend — we've got you covered with hidden chats! Such chats protected by password you will set and hidden from both chat and contact lists.\nHidden chats is a private feature just for your usage, so no one knows that chat is hidden on your device — even your participant.\n\nHidden chats available on phones only, tablets are not supported.\n\nFor support please visit anytalkapp.com/support\n9c91696931",

      "description": "Threema is the world’s best-selling secure messenger and keeps your data out of the hands of hackers, corporations, and governments. The service can be used completely anonymously. Threema is open source and offers every feature one would expect from a state-of-the-art instant messenger. The app also allows to make end-to-end encrypted voice, video and group calls. Using the desktop app and the web client, you can also use Threema from your desktop.\n\nPRIVACY AND ANONYMITY\nThreema is designed from the ground up to generate as little data on servers as possible. Group memberships and contact lists are managed on your device only, and never stored on our servers. Messages are immediately deleted after they have been delivered. Local files are stored encrypted on your mobile phone or tablet. All this effectively prevents the collection and misuse of your personal information, including metadata. Threema is fully compliant with the European privacy legislation (GDPR).\n\nROCK-SOLID ENCRYPTION\nThreema end-to-end encrypts all your communication, including messages, voice and video calls, group chats, files, and even status messages. Only the intended recipient, and nobody else, can read your messages. Threema uses the trusted open source NaCl cryptography library for encryption. The encryption keys are generated and safely stored on the users’ devices to prevent backdoor access or copies.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE FEATURES \nThreema is not only an encrypted and private messenger but also versatile and feature-rich.\n\n• Write text and send voice messages\n• Edit and delete sent messages on the recipient’s end\n• Make voice, video and group calls\n• Share videos, pictures and locations\n• Send any type of file (PDF, animated GIF, MP3, DOC, ZIP, etc.)\n• Use the desktop app or the web client to chat from your computer\n• Create groups\n• Conduct polls\n• Choose between a dark and a light theme\n• React to messages with emojis\n• Verify the identity of a contact by scanning their personal QR code\n• Use Threema as anonymous instant messaging tool\n• Synchronize your contacts (optional)\n\nSERVERS IN SWITZERLAND\nAll our servers are located in Switzerland, and we develop our software in-house.\n\nFULL ANONYMITY\nEach Threema user receives a random Threema ID for identification. A phone number or email address is not required to use Threema. This unique feature allows you to use Threema completely anonymously – no need to give up private information or to open an account. \n\nOPEN SOURCE AND AUDITS\nThe source code of the Threema app is open for everyone to review. On top of that, renowned experts are regularly commissioned to conduct systematic security audits of Threema’s code.\n\nNO ADS, NO TRACKERS\nThreema is not financed by advertising and does not collect user data.\n\nSUPPORT / CONTACT\nFor questions or problems please consult our FAQs: https://threema.ch/en/faq",

        "description": "Threema is the world’s best-selling secure messenger and keeps your data out of the hands of hackers, corporations, and governments. The service can be used completely anonymously. Threema is open source and offers every feature one would expect from a state-of-the-art instant messenger. The app also allows to make end-to-end encrypted voice, video and group calls. Using the desktop app and the web client, you can also use Threema from your desktop.\n\nPRIVACY AND ANONYMITY\nThreema is designed from the ground up to generate as little data on servers as possible. Group memberships and contact lists are managed on your device only, and never stored on our servers. Messages are immediately deleted after they have been delivered. Local files are stored encrypted on your mobile phone or tablet. All this effectively prevents the collection and misuse of your personal information, including metadata. Threema is fully compliant with the European privacy legislation (GDPR).\n\nROCK-SOLID ENCRYPTION\nThreema end-to-end encrypts all your communication, including messages, voice and video calls, group chats, files, and even status messages. Only the intended recipient, and nobody else, can read your messages. Threema uses the trusted open source NaCl cryptography library for encryption. The encryption keys are generated and safely stored on the users’ devices to prevent backdoor access or copies.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE FEATURES \nThreema is not only an encrypted and private messenger but also versatile and feature-rich.\n\n• Write text and send voice messages\n• Edit and delete sent messages on the recipient’s end\n• Make voice, video and group calls\n• Share videos, pictures and locations\n• Send any type of file (PDF, animated GIF, MP3, DOC, ZIP, etc.)\n• Use the desktop app or the web client to chat from your computer\n• Create groups\n• Conduct polls\n• Choose between a dark and a light theme\n• React to messages with emojis\n• Verify the identity of a contact by scanning their personal QR code\n• Use Threema as anonymous instant messaging tool\n• Synchronize your contacts (optional)\n\nSERVERS IN SWITZERLAND\nAll our servers are located in Switzerland, and we develop our software in-house.\n\nFULL ANONYMITY\nEach Threema user receives a random Threema ID for identification. A phone number or email address is not required to use Threema. This unique feature allows you to use Threema completely anonymously – no need to give up private information or to open an account. \n\nOPEN SOURCE AND AUDITS\nThe source code of the Threema app is open for everyone to review. On top of that, renowned experts are regularly commissioned to conduct systematic security audits of Threema’s code.\n\nNO ADS, NO TRACKERS\nThreema is not financed by advertising and does not collect user data.\n\nSUPPORT / CONTACT\nFor questions or problems please consult our FAQs: https://threema.ch/en/faq",

      "description": "ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR and OMEMO encryption over XMPP. You can create new accounts on public XMPP servers, or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR, OMEMO and XMPP.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

      "description": "** Requires a Message Catalogue account.\n\n### WHAT IS MESSAGE CATALOGUE?\nFinally, one place to keep everything about your messages.\n\nWith this powerful new digital catalogue, you can group your messages by series and search by keyword or Scripture reference, all while personalizing your catalogue to fit your needs with graphics, outlines, supporting message illustrations and more. \n\nTrying to remember or find a previous talk? You can fully search titles, keywords, notes, and many other attributes to help you find your content. \n\nWith each entry, you can load your photos, audio, video, documents and any other supporting items. Anything that has text, like a transcript or outline, will become searchable as well!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n### ABOUT THE iOS APP:\nThe Message Catalogue iOS app is the best way to view and search for your message content. Being built fully natively for iPhone and iPad technologies, you will discover a fast and intuitive experience.\n\n\nGeneral Features:\n\n• See all of your messages grouped by series.\n• Message entries are marked if they are a favorite, work in-progress, or not in a default location to help you easily identify them.\n• Switch to the search / list view to browse individually.\n• Sort your browsing by the message date, to help you find your oldest messages.\n• **See your history or recently viewed messages.\n• Filter by default locations or work in-progress.\n• To do an exact search simply add a quote at the beginning or end, or anywhere in your search phrase.\n• When searching, see a preview text preview if the phrase was found in a document.\n• Search results will show a preview or tags if the phrase is found in the message data.\n• On the iPad, support for split screen and other layouts.\n• If your device is signed in with iCloud, you can “handoff” from one device to another. For instance, if you are looking at a message on a different device, the handoff icon will show on your mac’s dock. When clicking it, Message Catalogue will then open with that message entry in the viewer.\n\n\nMessage / Entry View Features:\n\n• Use the “heart” image to mark a favorite message which will sync with your account on other devices.\n• If your message has a link to a related plan with Planning Center Services, you can click the Planing Center icon to quickly take you there.\n• View the entry photos from the filmstrip and click on one to show it in a separate window.\n• Important assets are “starred” at the top of your file list so you can quickly get to then.\n• Web link assets will play in a video player window if able, or go straight to the web site.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFor more information about Message Catalogue, how it works, or go in depth more about the features, feel free to send us a note at support@messagecatalogue.com\n\nEnjoy!\n- Message Catalogue Team @WorfklowNetwork",

You can fully search titles, keywords, notes, and many other attributes to help you find your content. \n\nWith each entry, you can load your photos, audio, video, documents and any other supporting items. Anything that has text, like a transcript or outline, will become searchable as well!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n### ABOUT THE iOS APP:\nThe Message Catalogue iOS app is the best way to view and search for your message content. Being built fully natively for iPhone and iPad technologies, you will discover a fast and intuitive experience.\n\n\nGeneral Features:\n\n• See all of your messages grouped by series.\n• Message entries are marked if they are a favorite, work in-progress, or not in a default location to help you easily identify them.\n• Switch to the search / list view to browse individually.\n• Sort your browsing by the message date, to help you find your oldest messages.\n• **See your history or recently viewed messages.\n• Filter by default locations or work in-progress.\n• To do an exact search simply add a quote at the beginning or end, or anywhere in your search phrase.\n• When searching, see a preview text preview if the phrase was found in a document.\n• Search results will show a preview or tags if the phrase is found in the message data.\n• On the iPad, support for split screen and other layouts.\n• If your device is signed in with iCloud, you can “handoff” from one device to another. For instance, if you are looking at a message on a different device, the handoff icon will show on your mac’s dock. When clicking it, Message Catalogue will then open with that message entry in the viewer.\n\n\nMessage / Entry View Features:\n\n• Use the “heart” image to mark a favorite message which will sync with your account on other devices.\n• If your message has a link to a related plan with Planning Center Services, you can click the Planing Center icon to quickly take you there.\n• View the entry photos from the filmstrip and click on one to show it in a separate window.\n• Important assets are “starred” at the top of your file list so you can quickly get to then.\n• Web link assets will play in a video player window if able, or go straight to the web site.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFor more information about Message Catalogue, how it works, or go in depth more about the features, feel free to send us a note at support@messagecatalogue.com\n\nEnjoy!\n- Message Catalogue Team @WorfklowNetwork",

        "releaseNotes": "This release brings enhanced privacy controls, better collaboration across organizational boundaries, and improvements to document workflows with BuzzDrive—delivering even more power and flexibility to care teams and healthcare professionals.\n\n** Enhanced Security & Privacy for Multi-Org Communication **\n\nThis version enhances fine-grained privacy settings for secure 1:1 and group messaging across multiple organizations. When users belong to more than one organization, Buzz ensures that sensitive information is only visible based on each organization’s configured rules—preserving patient privacy and organizational sensitivity while enabling seamless collaboration across entities.\n\n** Reliable Encryption with Smart Recovery **\n\nWe’ve squashed an edge case where messages could fail to decrypt—often caused by users (or their devices) hoarding old public keys like they were Bitcoin. Buzz now smartly detects and recovers from these situations, ensuring secure messages stay readable and your workflow remains uninterrupted. No technical wizardry needed on your end—we’ve got it handled.\n\n** Larger, Secure Payloads on iOS notifications **\n\nImportant messages won’t get truncated. We’ve extended support for encrypted notifications, working around iOS’s payload limitations to ensure more context-rich alerts, even when your phone is locked.\n\n****\n\nBuzzDrive™ & Group Collaboration Enhancements\n\n** Track File Sharing with BuzzDrive Audit Trails **\n\nWe’ve introduced meta messages to track when files are added, removed, or modified in BuzzDrive. This gives care teams better visibility and traceability of shared documents like consents, forms, and discharge instructions.\n\n** Invite Non-Buzz Users with BuzzLink™ for Collaboration **\n\nNow you can seamlessly add patients, family members, or external providers (like referral partners) to a conversation using BuzzLink—with no app download required. They can fill forms, view schedules, or review consents securely. The organization remains in full control, and there is no cost to you for inviting external participants.\n\n** Mixed Security Mode for Group Sharing **\nEffectively add non-Buzz users like patients or family members (using BuzzLink through SMS or Email channels) to Buzz collaboration groups for care coordination, onboarding, schedule and consent management.\n\nNot every piece of information needs full encryption. New contextual switches let authorized users share select messages (like event reminders or general updates) in plaintext with BuzzLink users, while keeping all clinical and sensitive content securely encrypted. This hybrid model improves communication flow without compromising security.\n\n****\n\n** Admin & Account Management Improvements **\nStreamlined Invite Process: We’ve made it easier for new users to redeem invites and join your organization quickly.\nInvite-Only Access: Buzz now offers a “walled garden” setup where new account creation is limited to validated users with invitations—ensuring only authorized professionals gain access to sensitive collaboration environments.\n\n****\n\n** BuzzDrive and BuzzFlow™ Synergy **\n\nThis release sets the stage for deeper integration with BuzzFlow, our next-generation document workflow engine for consent forms, care plans, and insurance workflows—without the complexity or cost of legacy solutions like DocuSign® or SignNow enterprise portals.",
