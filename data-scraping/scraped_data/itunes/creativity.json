      "description": "So you think you understand this thing you’re holding? Think again. Stop tapping. Stop swiping. In fact, stop touching the screen at all. To crack Blackbox’s puzzles you’ll need to find solitude and stillness, climb mountains, call on friends, get in tune with the cosmos, and think outside the box.\n\nMinimalistic visual clues make for incredibly satisfying “Aha!” moments, while sonic interfaces provide an extra level of guidance and nuance that makes Blackbox accessible with or without vision. Thoughtful haptic feedback, Easter eggs on Easter eggs, and solutions that can’t be found beneath the glass of your screen redefine what a puzzle can be. You’ll never see your device the same way again.\n\nThink you’re clever? Prove it.\n\n(Blackbox is a living game under active development by Ryan McLeod. When not eating burritos or drinking coffee, he’s busy designing and developing new Blackbox challenges.)\n\n■",

      "description": "To have good ideas, have many.\n\nIdeas are the currency of life.\n\nIdeaPad helps you exercise your idea muscle to strengthen it. You must stop censoring your own ideas in order to get used to having them, noticing them, and developing them. Practice daily by writing down 10 ideas. Or any number really. Hold yourself to a daily practice to improve your ability to come up with ideas and solve problems.\n\nIdeaPad is very simple: write or speak your idea. Save it. Repeat. The main purpose of IdeaPad is to practice expressing them, not to make sure they are all great, not to develop them into something bigger, not to judge them. All of these steps come later. Because of this, IdeaPad doesn’t allow you to edit past ideas. You can’t delete them (unless you delete the app). You can only add to them. Get used to producing ideas... and producing lots of them.\n\nWhat to do if you can’t come up with 10 ideas? Come up with 20! Give yourself less time to write them to make sure your inner censor doesn’t stand a chance. Use our inspirations to set a topic for your idea-generating session.\n\nThink you are onto something really great? We are not here to steal it. We never upload your ideas anywhere. If you want, you can export all your ideas by sending them to yourself via email. Then do with them what you want: start that new project, build a successful business, do something amazing, have fun!\n\nHappy ideating!",

        "description": "To have good ideas, have many.\n\nIdeas are the currency of life.\n\nIdeaPad helps you exercise your idea muscle to strengthen it. You must stop censoring your own ideas in order to get used to having them, noticing them, and developing them. Practice daily by writing down 10 ideas. Or any number really. Hold yourself to a daily practice to improve your ability to come up with ideas and solve problems.\n\nIdeaPad is very simple: write or speak your idea. Save it. Repeat. The main purpose of IdeaPad is to practice expressing them, not to make sure they are all great, not to develop them into something bigger, not to judge them. All of these steps come later. Because of this, IdeaPad doesn’t allow you to edit past ideas. You can’t delete them (unless you delete the app). You can only add to them. Get used to producing ideas... and producing lots of them.\n\nWhat to do if you can’t come up with 10 ideas? Come up with 20! Give yourself less time to write them to make sure your inner censor doesn’t stand a chance. Use our inspirations to set a topic for your idea-generating session.\n\nThink you are onto something really great? We are not here to steal it. We never upload your ideas anywhere. If you want, you can export all your ideas by sending them to yourself via email. Then do with them what you want: start that new project, build a successful business, do something amazing, have fun!\n\nHappy ideating!",

      "description": "Pause is an app to help anyone develop a creative mindset. It presents you with daily prompts to learn and practice creative thinking as well as tracking your creative cycle. For those who don’t believe they have a creative bone in their body, this app will help develop your understanding of your creative mind. For all who use the app, you’ll be able to choose the days when you need to take in beauty, ingest and process things. You’ll also be able to choose the days when you feel ready to create -- to make something or pour out creativity.\n\nThe fundamental idea of Pause is taken from “The Creative Pause”, written by Lajos Szekely in 1967 for the International Journal of Psycho-Analysis. Szekely defines the creative pause as: \n\nThe time interval beginning from the moment the thinker interrupts his conscious occupation with an unsolved problem, and ends when the solution of the problem or a partial solution or otherwise an insight suddenly and unexpectedly occurs.\n\nThe Creative Pause is commonly referred to when people talk about “shower ideas” or those great ideas that come to you when you’re not even thinking about the problem at hand. We want to help you develop those “Aha” moments with guided practice.\n\nPause helps you develop productive problem solving. Daily prompts intentionally walk you through practicing restructuring thought patterns and embracing the creative pause. There’s beauty in the rhythms of life and we have embraced both seasonal and daily rhythms in this app. The daily prompts to cover each season of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. As each season progresses the prompts will walk you through categories such as:\n\n* Introducing the Creative Pause\n* Generating Alternatives\n* Challenging Assumptions\n* Picking Out Dominant Ideas\n* Knowing Yourself \n* Generating Analogies for Problem Solving\n* Identifying Child-Like Patterns From Past\n* Enjoying Random Stimulation\n* Challenging Labels\n* Focusing Attention Area\n* Exploring Dream State\n* Reversing Challenges\n* Observing\n\nEach day when you open the app, you have the option to choose between:\n* In\n* Out\n\nIn: For the days when you’re not feeling especially creative, don’t have the energy or inspiration and instead need to take in art or process thoughts.\nOut: For the days when you’re wanting to do something, to make something or experience something -- when you’re feeling in the creative mood.\n\n* When you finish the prompt for the day (whether “in” or “out”), mark it as complete. (If you don’t finish a prompt, leave it unmarked.)\n* At midnight each night, the app resets to the main “in” and “out” screen and a new set of prompts will be presented.\n* As you make selections each day, you will progress chronologically through the season’s prompts, walking you intentionally through categories to develop creative thought patterns.\n* On the first day of each new season, an entire new set of prompts will load and the strategic practice will begin again.",

        "description": "Pause is an app to help anyone develop a creative mindset. It presents you with daily prompts to learn and practice creative thinking as well as tracking your creative cycle. For those who don’t believe they have a creative bone in their body, this app will help develop your understanding of your creative mind. For all who use the app, you’ll be able to choose the days when you need to take in beauty, ingest and process things. You’ll also be able to choose the days when you feel ready to create -- to make something or pour out creativity.\n\nThe fundamental idea of Pause is taken from “The Creative Pause”, written by Lajos Szekely in 1967 for the International Journal of Psycho-Analysis. Szekely defines the creative pause as: \n\nThe time interval beginning from the moment the thinker interrupts his conscious occupation with an unsolved problem, and ends when the solution of the problem or a partial solution or otherwise an insight suddenly and unexpectedly occurs.\n\nThe Creative Pause is commonly referred to when people talk about “shower ideas” or those great ideas that come to you when you’re not even thinking about the problem at hand. We want to help you develop those “Aha” moments with guided practice.\n\nPause helps you develop productive problem solving. Daily prompts intentionally walk you through practicing restructuring thought patterns and embracing the creative pause. There’s beauty in the rhythms of life and we have embraced both seasonal and daily rhythms in this app. The daily prompts to cover each season of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. As each season progresses the prompts will walk you through categories such as:\n\n* Introducing the Creative Pause\n* Generating Alternatives\n* Challenging Assumptions\n* Picking Out Dominant Ideas\n* Knowing Yourself \n* Generating Analogies for Problem Solving\n* Identifying Child-Like Patterns From Past\n* Enjoying Random Stimulation\n* Challenging Labels\n* Focusing Attention Area\n* Exploring Dream State\n* Reversing Challenges\n* Observing\n\nEach day when you open the app, you have the option to choose between:\n* In\n* Out\n\nIn: For the days when you’re not feeling especially creative, don’t have the energy or inspiration and instead need to take in art or process thoughts.\nOut: For the days when you’re wanting to do something, to make something or experience something -- when you’re feeling in the creative mood.\n\n* When you finish the prompt for the day (whether “in” or “out”), mark it as complete. (If you don’t finish a prompt, leave it unmarked.)\n* At midnight each night, the app resets to the main “in” and “out” screen and a new set of prompts will be presented.\n* As you make selections each day, you will progress chronologically through the season’s prompts, walking you intentionally through categories to develop creative thought patterns.\n* On the first day of each new season, an entire new set of prompts will load and the strategic practice will begin again.",

      "description": "Ulysses is your one-stop writing environment for Mac, iPhone and iPad. Its pleasant, focused writing experience, combined with effective document management, seamless sync, and flexible export, make Ulysses the first choice for writers of all kinds.\n\n++ Apple Design Award Winner 2016 ++ \n\n“The app is amazing. An absolute delight to use. Well done.”\n– David Hewson, Bestselling Author (The Killing)\n\n### A Text Production Powerhouse\nUlysses’ markup-based, distraction-free editor lets you focus on your most important task: Write, edit, and write some more. Formatting is kept for later, so you can completely immerse yourself in the text. Ulysses’ uniquely streamlined toolset covers the entire writing process, and its clean and simple interface will boost your productivity. From first to final draft, from prologue to closing chapter – Ulysses keeps you in the flow, so you can get stuff done.\n\n### All Your Texts, All the Time\nEverything you’ll ever write is stored in Ulysses’ unified library. You can manage projects of all kinds and sizes, be it novels, diaries or study notes – they are always saved, and automatically in sync. And since Ulysses offers feature parity across macOS and iOS, it doesn’t matter where you are or when inspiration hits: All its tools, and all your texts, are always at your fingertips.\n\n### Built-In Proofreader and Editing Assistant\nWrite with confidence, thanks to Ulysses’ integrated grammar and style check. Available for over 20 languages, it analyzes your text and offers informed suggestions for capitalization, punctuation, semantics, redundancy, style and more. \n\n### Create eBooks, DOCX, PDFs and HTML\nUlysses’ export is flexible enough to cover any writer’s needs: Transform your text into beautiful PDFs, Word documents or eBooks. Or export HTML code, ready to be used anywhere on the web. You can even choose between a variety of pre-made formatting styles for all kinds of purposes, or create your own and share it with other users.\n\n### Publish to WordPress, Ghost & More\nDo you blog? Ulysses’ offers best-in-class publishing to WordPress, Ghost, Medium, and Micro.blog. You can post to WordPress, Ghost and Micro.blog from right within the app – complete with images, tags, categories etc. Publishing to Medium works just as easy, and all four offer a built-in preview to proofread before submission.\n\n### Pricing\nUlysses requires a subscription. We offer monthly and yearly subscription plans. They include a fully functional trial, so you can test Ulysses (including export and sync). There’s also a special discount for students.\n\nAll plans unlock the app on Mac, iPhone and iPad, and feature full synchronization.\n\n### Questions\nPlease visit ulysses.app for more information. You can also reach us via help@ulysses.app or on Twitter @ulyssesapp – we’re happily awaiting your feedback!\n\nTerms of Use: https://ulysses.app/app-terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy: https://ulysses.app/app-privacy-policy",

        "description": "Ulysses is your one-stop writing environment for Mac, iPhone and iPad. Its pleasant, focused writing experience, combined with effective document management, seamless sync, and flexible export, make Ulysses the first choice for writers of all kinds.\n\n++ Apple Design Award Winner 2016 ++ \n\n“The app is amazing. An absolute delight to use. Well done.”\n– David Hewson, Bestselling Author (The Killing)\n\n### A Text Production Powerhouse\nUlysses’ markup-based, distraction-free editor lets you focus on your most important task: Write, edit, and write some more. Formatting is kept for later, so you can completely immerse yourself in the text. Ulysses’ uniquely streamlined toolset covers the entire writing process, and its clean and simple interface will boost your productivity. From first to final draft, from prologue to closing chapter – Ulysses keeps you in the flow, so you can get stuff done.\n\n### All Your Texts, All the Time\nEverything you’ll ever write is stored in Ulysses’ unified library. You can manage projects of all kinds and sizes, be it novels, diaries or study notes – they are always saved, and automatically in sync. And since Ulysses offers feature parity across macOS and iOS, it doesn’t matter where you are or when inspiration hits: All its tools, and all your texts, are always at your fingertips.\n\n### Built-In Proofreader and Editing Assistant\nWrite with confidence, thanks to Ulysses’ integrated grammar and style check. Available for over 20 languages, it analyzes your text and offers informed suggestions for capitalization, punctuation, semantics, redundancy, style and more. \n\n### Create eBooks, DOCX, PDFs and HTML\nUlysses’ export is flexible enough to cover any writer’s needs: Transform your text into beautiful PDFs, Word documents or eBooks. Or export HTML code, ready to be used anywhere on the web. You can even choose between a variety of pre-made formatting styles for all kinds of purposes, or create your own and share it with other users.\n\n### Publish to WordPress, Ghost & More\nDo you blog? Ulysses’ offers best-in-class publishing to WordPress, Ghost, Medium, and Micro.blog. You can post to WordPress, Ghost and Micro.blog from right within the app – complete with images, tags, categories etc. Publishing to Medium works just as easy, and all four offer a built-in preview to proofread before submission.\n\n### Pricing\nUlysses requires a subscription. We offer monthly and yearly subscription plans. They include a fully functional trial, so you can test Ulysses (including export and sync). There’s also a special discount for students.\n\nAll plans unlock the app on Mac, iPhone and iPad, and feature full synchronization.\n\n### Questions\nPlease visit ulysses.app for more information. You can also reach us via help@ulysses.app or on Twitter @ulyssesapp – we’re happily awaiting your feedback!\n\nTerms of Use: https://ulysses.app/app-terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy: https://ulysses.app/app-privacy-policy",

The vision behind this platform is to innovate and optimize the PROCESS of creative. As a creative, brand or agency, you shouldn't be spending hours on logistics, emails, creating documents, finding old photos but instead be focused on the creative shoot. We are striving to consolidate everything so that you can create.\n\nNote from our Founder:\nHello there!\n\nI'm so excited to have you begin testing our platform! I started as a photographer and this software has been many years in the making. We are currently beta testing the platform and working tirelessly to perfect each feature for an incredible experience so please bear with us if you encounter any issues or bugs. \n\nLastly, any feedback is highly valued as your insight helps us create the best possible product!

Instead of multiple PDF's, text threads with Inso images, everything is in one place for everyone involved to be on the same page.\n\nWith the right structure and process, anything can be made. The vision behind this platform is to innovate and optimize the PROCESS of creative. As a creative, brand or agency, you shouldn't be spending hours on logistics, emails, creating documents, finding old photos but instead be focused on the creative shoot. We are striving to consolidate everything so that you can create.\n\nNote from our Founder:\nHello there!\n\nI'm so excited to have you begin testing our platform! I started as a photographer and this software has been many years in the making. We are currently beta testing the platform and working tirelessly to perfect each feature for an incredible experience so please bear with us if you encounter any issues or bugs. \n\nLastly, any feedback is highly valued as your insight helps us create the best possible product! Feel free to reach out on the app or on socials with any feedback or just to say hey! \n\nThank you for stopping by, and lets get to creating!\n\nSpencer Davis\nPhotographer, Storyteller, Founder\n@shotlistapp | @spencerdavisphoto",

      "description": "Meet your new muse. Destroy writer's block forever. Escape the beaten path and discover what you *didn't know* you wanted to say.\n\n〰 Bypass your ego and regain your creative spark\n - When experiencing writer's block our own minds can be our worst enemy. \n - We get caught in the mud, hung up, and mope around in endless ruts, seemingly cursed by an infinite loop of inaction.  \n - But sometimes we've just got to hit refresh, shuffle the deck, ruffle some feathers, evacuate our comfort zones, and sidestep our rituals and habits.\n - When songwriters get stuck -- they switch to a different instrument\n - WordPalette is a different instrument!\n\n〰 Up to six sliding lanes of intelligently scrambled text\n - Short poetic phrases are intuitively grouped and stair-cased across the slider lanes\n - Each lane slides in both directions independently \n - The phrases are loaded from Palettes (your collected text sources)\n\n〰 Quickly switch between keyboards\n - Simply tap the keyboard button, or swipe left to quickly switch between the slider lanes and the default iOS keyboard\n - You're not just switching between keyboards but between creative states\n - Many workflows are possible : \n - Rapid-fire between the keyboards, leveraging the \"found\" inspiration of the sliders with your own creative reactions.\n - Use the sliders to amass a collection of words that resonate with you, then switch to the default keyboard and weave them together.\n - For cut-up method purists: use *only* the word sliders, hunting through the lanes for the perfect compliments and juxtapositions.\n\n〰 Import your favorite text sources and convert them into Palettes.\n - Palettes are converted sources of text used to populate the word sliders.\n - Instantly paste copied text via the Add (+) button on the Palettes page, and convert.\n - You can also import plain .txt files from iCloud Drive and other popular cloud services\n - Alternatively, enable our Share extension to send text from other apps to be converted into Palettes.\n\n〰 Mix and match your Palettes \n - Activate and deactivate your collected Palettes to control what appears in the word sliders.\n - The word slider keyboard will only pull phrases from currently activated Palettes.\n - Get creative with your combinations! (i.e., text from an article on underwater birth, and an article on the predatory habits of sharks)\n\n〰 Contact\n - https://wordpalette.io\n - dev@wordpalette.io\n - @wordpalettes on Twitter / Instagram\n\n¶",

Escape the beaten path and discover what you *didn't know* you wanted to say.\n\n〰 Bypass your ego and regain your creative spark\n - When experiencing writer's block our own minds can be our worst enemy. \n - We get caught in the mud, hung up, and mope around in endless ruts, seemingly cursed by an infinite loop of inaction.  \n - But sometimes we've just got to hit refresh, shuffle the deck, ruffle some feathers, evacuate our comfort zones, and sidestep our rituals and habits.\n - When songwriters get stuck -- they switch to a different instrument\n - WordPalette is a different instrument!\n\n〰 Up to six sliding lanes of intelligently scrambled text\n - Short poetic phrases are intuitively grouped and stair-cased across the slider lanes\n - Each lane slides in both directions independently \n - The phrases are loaded from Palettes (your collected text sources)\n\n〰 Quickly switch between keyboards\n - Simply tap the keyboard button, or swipe left to quickly switch between the slider lanes and the default iOS keyboard\n - You're not just switching between keyboards but between creative states\n - Many workflows are possible : \n - Rapid-fire between the keyboards, leveraging the \"found\" inspiration of the sliders with your own creative reactions.\n - Use the sliders to amass a collection of words that resonate with you, then switch to the default keyboard and weave them together.\n - For cut-up method purists: use *only* the word sliders, hunting through the lanes for the perfect compliments and juxtapositions.\n\n〰 Import your favorite text sources and convert them into Palettes.\n - Palettes are converted sources of text used to populate the word sliders.\n - Instantly paste copied text via the Add (+) button on the Palettes page, and convert.\n - You can also import plain .txt files from iCloud Drive and other popular cloud services\n - Alternatively, enable our Share extension to send text from other apps to be converted into Palettes.\n\n〰 Mix and match your Palettes \n - Activate and deactivate your collected Palettes to control what appears in the word sliders.\n - The word slider keyboard will only pull phrases from currently activated Palettes.\n - Get creative with your combinations! (i.e., text from an article on underwater birth, and an article on the predatory habits of sharks)\n\n〰 Contact\n - https://wordpalette.io\n - dev@wordpalette.io\n - @wordpalettes on Twitter / Instagram\n\n¶",

      "description": "Why? If you ask a creative person, the answer will always revolve around time. We simply need time to execute an idea (and do it well)—more time than we have.\n\nA process that takes you from idea to final product can take 3 weeks, but could just as well take 3 months, 3 days, or 3 years. You could even go through the process in 3 minutes: you sketch a few options, pick one, and ‘finalize’ it as much as you can in the short time you have left. The end result of such a 3-minute round could be a clear sketch or small mock-up, for instance.\n\nUse the ToDon’tTimer to sketch and test your ideas in a limited timeframe. Decide to add the idea to your ToDon’tList or to spend a bigger timeframe on it.\n\n––––\n\nYou can use the ToDon’tTimer for all your creative processes. The ToDon’tTimer is also an interesting addition to Don’t/Do This – Game.\n\n––––\n\nThe Circular Design Process\nThis method requires you to work quickly and roughly, leaving out many details and forcing you to make essential choices. That is why those 3 minutes will tell you a great deal about the overall process: not just what the end product will look like, but also which pitfalls you might encounter along the way. Should the idea turn out not to work or be feasible, then you will only have spent 3 minutes on it, which leaves you plenty of time to start over and try out other possibilities.\n\nOf course, you can apply this principle in different timeframes, going from very short to longer rounds. After the first 3-minute round, you might have a number of sketches. After a round of 3 hours, you could have a sketch model. After 3 days you could have a number of prototypes and after 3 weeks you will have an end result without any stress. The great benefit of working in circles: after those first 3 minutes, you can already discuss the project with your client or teacher. And after a few days, you could have some prototypes to present.\n\nWhen you work in increasingly bigger circles, as it were, you have much more space to try out and test things. That way you discover what does and what doesn’t work. Each following round, you bring your experience from the previous round with you.",

        "description": "Why? If you ask a creative person, the answer will always revolve around time. We simply need time to execute an idea (and do it well)—more time than we have.\n\nA process that takes you from idea to final product can take 3 weeks, but could just as well take 3 months, 3 days, or 3 years. You could even go through the process in 3 minutes: you sketch a few options, pick one, and ‘finalize’ it as much as you can in the short time you have left. The end result of such a 3-minute round could be a clear sketch or small mock-up, for instance.\n\nUse the ToDon’tTimer to sketch and test your ideas in a limited timeframe. Decide to add the idea to your ToDon’tList or to spend a bigger timeframe on it.\n\n––––\n\nYou can use the ToDon’tTimer for all your creative processes. The ToDon’tTimer is also an interesting addition to Don’t/Do This – Game.\n\n––––\n\nThe Circular Design Process\nThis method requires you to work quickly and roughly, leaving out many details and forcing you to make essential choices. That is why those 3 minutes will tell you a great deal about the overall process: not just what the end product will look like, but also which pitfalls you might encounter along the way. Should the idea turn out not to work or be feasible, then you will only have spent 3 minutes on it, which leaves you plenty of time to start over and try out other possibilities.\n\nOf course, you can apply this principle in different timeframes, going from very short to longer rounds. After the first 3-minute round, you might have a number of sketches. After a round of 3 hours, you could have a sketch model. After 3 days you could have a number of prototypes and after 3 weeks you will have an end result without any stress. The great benefit of working in circles: after those first 3 minutes, you can already discuss the project with your client or teacher. And after a few days, you could have some prototypes to present.\n\nWhen you work in increasingly bigger circles, as it were, you have much more space to try out and test things. That way you discover what does and what doesn’t work. Each following round, you bring your experience from the previous round with you.",

      "description": "*** Create Art. Even if you can't draw. ***\n\nPattern Artist is a unique and fun app for quickly creating beautiful custom repeating patterns and abstract art. Even if you don't consider yourself an artist, with Pattern Artist, you can be! Use it to make wallpapers, website backgrounds (including Facebook, Twitter and Flickr home pages), calendars, custom photo frames, pattern resources for other art programs, or just because you love making art! \n\nPattern Artist is not a painting app but a novel template-based approach to creating captivating designs. The basics are simple - you will likely create your first design in just a few minutes - yet it has the capability and flexibility to be a serious art creation tool.\n\nIf you want a unique background for your mobile device or your website, Pattern Artist provides a refreshing alternative to all the \"wallpaper gallery\" apps you've used. Rather than browsing through pages of pre-built backgrounds to find a wallpaper that appeals to you, why not create a customized background pattern with the design, colors, textures and scaling that appeals to your artistic tastes and/or design requirements?\n\nDownload Pattern Artist Free to discover just how fun creating artistic patterns can be. The free version of the app allows you to try out all the features of Pattern Artist, limiting only the number of templates and color schemes provided, the number of custom color schemes you can create, and the output resolution of some of the tools. \n\nFeatures:\n- powerful color selection tools for accurately choosing colors\n- built-in palette of textures to add a detailed \"finishing touch\" to your pattern \n- add text labels to images. Save labels for easy reuse\n- post to Instagram, including managing/assigning hashtags\n- build a collection of custom color schemes entirely within the app, or import color schemes created externally\n- create calendars or frame photos using any of your created patterns directly in the app\n- library and slideshow for displaying your artistic creations\n- Airplay support (e.g. view the full repeating pattern on your Apple TV while zoomed-in to edit)\n- export patterns to iPhoto for use as home screen or lock screen wallpaper\n- send patterns via email, print, or copy via pasteboard into other art apps\n- print \"line-only\" version of patterns for hand coloring with crayons, pastels, markers, paint, etc.\n- share to Facebook and Twitter (iOS 6+ only).\n- supports both landscape and portrait use on iPad\n\n\nSee a gallery of samples on Instagram: http://Instagram.com/patternartist\nor on Flickr: http://flickr.com/photos/patternartist\nor on",

        "description": "*** Create Art. Even if you can't draw. ***\n\nPattern Artist is a unique and fun app for quickly creating beautiful custom repeating patterns and abstract art. Even if you don't consider yourself an artist, with Pattern Artist, you can be! Use it to make wallpapers, website backgrounds (including Facebook, Twitter and Flickr home pages), calendars, custom photo frames, pattern resources for other art programs, or just because you love making art! \n\nPattern Artist is not a painting app but a novel template-based approach to creating captivating designs. The basics are simple - you will likely create your first design in just a few minutes - yet it has the capability and flexibility to be a serious art creation tool.\n\nIf you want a unique background for your mobile device or your website, Pattern Artist provides a refreshing alternative to all the \"wallpaper gallery\" apps you've used. Rather than browsing through pages of pre-built backgrounds to find a wallpaper that appeals to you, why not create a customized background pattern with the design, colors, textures and scaling that appeals to your artistic tastes and/or design requirements?\n\nDownload Pattern Artist Free to discover just how fun creating artistic patterns can be. The free version of the app allows you to try out all the features of Pattern Artist, limiting only the number of templates and color schemes provided, the number of custom color schemes you can create, and the output resolution of some of the tools. \n\nFeatures:\n- powerful color selection tools for accurately choosing colors\n- built-in palette of textures to add a detailed \"finishing touch\" to your pattern \n- add text labels to images. Save labels for easy reuse\n- post to Instagram, including managing/assigning hashtags\n- build a collection of custom color schemes entirely within the app, or import color schemes created externally\n- create calendars or frame photos using any of your created patterns directly in the app\n- library and slideshow for displaying your artistic creations\n- Airplay support (e.g. view the full repeating pattern on your Apple TV while zoomed-in to edit)\n- export patterns to iPhoto for use as home screen or lock screen wallpaper\n- send patterns via email, print, or copy via pasteboard into other art apps\n- print \"line-only\" version of patterns for hand coloring with crayons, pastels, markers, paint, etc.\n- share to Facebook and Twitter (iOS 6+ only).\n- supports both landscape and portrait use on iPad\n\n\nSee a gallery of samples on Instagram: http://Instagram.com/patternartist\nor on Flickr: http://flickr.com/photos/patternartist\nor on",

      "description": "3D visual thinking for creative brainstorming, problem solving, collaborative research and education. Beyond 3D mind mapping – reflecting how minds work.\n\nThortspace diverges from conventional mind-mapping and concept-mapping software in a number of ways:\n* Maps are structured around the surfaces of one or more spheres which are presented to the user in 3D\n* Map-nodes (called \"thorts\" in the product) can be associated in groups according to proximity, as well as connected by paths\n* Paths can be made to connect thort to group, thort to thort, group to group, thort to sphere, group to sphere, sphere to sphere\n* Multiple alternative arrangements of subsets of nodes can be stored and transitioned between\n* The concept of \"Journeys\" allows a series of viewpoints of maps in the 3D space to be visited sequentially, so as to make something of the form of a presentation\n* The product supports a rudimentary implementation of social networking and a newsfeed that allows users to track their own and others contributions across collaborative spheres\n\nSome of Thortspace's notable features:\n* 3D associative and linking structures based on spheres\n* Linking and association at multiple different levels of structure\n* Real-time collaboration\n* Sharing by email, social networking account, or by private link\n* 1-click publishing to the web\n* Thorts can contain images, URL links, and be colour coded in multiple alternative categorizations\n* Thortspace is designed to support: \n(1) experimental multi-perspectival reflection and play, \n(2) the creation of chunks of thinking as building blocks that can be used to build thinking structures, \n(3) process-orientation - thortspace empowers the journey, not just the destination, \n(4) synthesis as well as analysis\n\nGooisoft’s Thortspace software is subject to international copyright law (c) 2008-2020 and also international patent law with Granted Patents in USA, UK, Canada and Hong Kong: GB2494520, US9684426, CA2847602, HK1183135.",

Beyond 3D mind mapping – reflecting how minds work.\n\nThortspace diverges from conventional mind-mapping and concept-mapping software in a number of ways:\n* Maps are structured around the surfaces of one or more spheres which are presented to the user in 3D\n* Map-nodes (called \"thorts\" in the product) can be associated in groups according to proximity, as well as connected by paths\n* Paths can be made to connect thort to group, thort to thort, group to group, thort to sphere, group to sphere, sphere to sphere\n* Multiple alternative arrangements of subsets of nodes can be stored and transitioned between\n* The concept of \"Journeys\" allows a series of viewpoints of maps in the 3D space to be visited sequentially, so as to make something of the form of a presentation\n* The product supports a rudimentary implementation of social networking and a newsfeed that allows users to track their own and others contributions across collaborative spheres\n\nSome of Thortspace's notable features:\n* 3D associative and linking structures based on spheres\n* Linking and association at multiple different levels of structure\n* Real-time collaboration\n* Sharing by email, social networking account, or by private link\n* 1-click publishing to the web\n* Thorts can contain images, URL links, and be colour coded in multiple alternative categorizations\n* Thortspace is designed to support: \n(1) experimental multi-perspectival reflection and play, \n(2) the creation of chunks of thinking as building blocks that can be used to build thinking structures, \n(3) process-orientation - thortspace empowers the journey, not just the destination, \n(4) synthesis as well as analysis\n\nGooisoft’s Thortspace software is subject to international copyright law (c) 2008-2020 and also international patent law with Granted Patents in USA, UK, Canada and Hong Kong: GB2494520, US9684426, CA2847602, HK1183135.",
