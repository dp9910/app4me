      "description": "Say more with Threads — Instagram’s text-based conversation app.\n\nThreads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow. Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world!\n\nA few things you can do on Threads…\n\n■ Access your Instagram followers\nYour Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.\n\n■ Share your point of view\nSpin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.\n\n■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators\nJump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.\n\n■ Control the conversation\nCustomize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. \n\n■ Find ideas and inspiration\nFrom TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.\n\n■ Never miss a moment\nStay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.\n\n■ Leap into the fediverse\nThreads is part of the fediverse, a global, open, social network of independent servers operated by third parties around the world.

Whatever it is you’re interested in, you can follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things — or build a loyal following of your own to share your ideas, opinions and creativity with the world!\n\nA few things you can do on Threads…\n\n■ Access your Instagram followers\nYour Instagram username and verification badge are reserved for you. Automatically follow the same accounts you follow on Instagram in a few taps, and discover new accounts too.\n\n■ Share your point of view\nSpin up a new thread to express what's on your mind. This is your space to be yourself, and you control who can reply.\n\n■ Connect with friends and your favorite creators\nJump to the replies to get in on the action and react to commentary, humor and insight from the creators you know and love. Find your community and connect with people who care about whatever it is you’re interested in.\n\n■ Control the conversation\nCustomize your settings and use controls to manage who can see your content, reply to your threads, or mention you. Accounts you’ve blocked will carry over from Instagram, and we’re enforcing the same Community Guidelines to help ensure everyone interacts safely and authentically. \n\n■ Find ideas and inspiration\nFrom TV recommendations to career advice, get answers to your questions or learn something new from crowd-sourced conversations, thought leaders and industry experts.\n\n■ Never miss a moment\nStay on top of the latest trends and live events. Whether it’s about new music, movie premieres, sports, games, TV shows, fashion, or the latest product releases, find discussions and receive notifications any time your favorite profiles start a new thread.\n\n■ Leap into the fediverse\nThreads is part of the fediverse, a global, open, social network of independent servers operated by third parties around the world. Servers share information with each other to enable people to connect and discover new things across the fediverse.\n\n\nMeta Terms: https://www.facebook.com/terms.php\nMeta Privacy Policy: https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy\nThreads Supplemental Privacy Policy: https://help.instagram.com/515230437301944\nThreads Supplemental Terms: https://help.instagram.com/769983657850450\nInstagram Community Guidelines: https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119\nConsumer Health Privacy Policy: https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policies/health\n\nLearn how we're working to help keep our communities safe across Meta technologies at the Meta Safety Center: https://about.meta.com/actions/safety",

      "description": "Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.\n\nReddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.\n\nRedditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:\n• r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n• r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n• r/science, for scientific discussions and news\n• r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you’ll find:\n• Thousands of community groups\nBreaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n• Loads of laughs\nFind memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n\n• AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n• The best discussions on any topic\nReddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n• Get answers to anonymous questions \nAsk communities anything you want. Ask questions on relationships, mental health, parenting, career help, fitness plans, and more.\n\n• Anonymous profiles so you can do YOU\nConnect with people about any topic, join interactive community groups or threads, and chat with other redditors, all anonymously.\n\nVoting and Karma:\n\nInstead of likes and hearts, Reddit’s social network runs on upvotes or downvotes. Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.\n\nReddit Premium:\n\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy \nUser Agreement: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement \nReddit Rules: https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules\n\nIf you have any problems with the app, get support at RedditHelp.com",

        "description": "Welcome to Reddit, the heart of the internet.\n\nReddit is a social network with something for everyone: trending topics, diverse discussions, and engaging communities and comment threads.\n\nRedditors have authentic and interesting conversations around all sorts of curated content. You’ll find gaming communities, bloggers, meme-makers, fandoms, travel enthusiasts, support groups, AI forums, news junkies, artists, and creators of all types.\n\nReddit has over 100,000 online communities (forums where members post and comment) dedicated to specific topics. Some of the most popular communities are:\n• r/AskReddit, where users can ask and answer questions\n• r/funny, which is full of humorous content\n• r/science, for scientific discussions and news\n• r/gifs, with funny animated gifs for your viewing pleasure\n\nOn Reddit you’ll find:\n• Thousands of community groups\nBreaking news, social media trends, sports highlights, TV fan theories, open AI discussions and personalized content, there's a community for everyone.\n\n• Loads of laughs\nFind memes, oddly satisfying videos, funny cat videos, and more to help you lose track of time.\n\n• AMAs, or \"Ask Me Anything\"\nCelebrities, politicians, and experts answer questions from users.\n\n• The best discussions on any topic\nReddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in with humor and insights for just about anything; pop culture, sports, entertainment, or financial advice.\n\n• Get answers to anonymous questions \nAsk communities anything you want.

Voting on posts and comments increase or decrease the creator’s karma, and helps popular and relevant posts rise to the top, while filtering out low-quality or irrelevant posts.\n\nWhile karma doesn't directly impact your ability to use Reddit, more karma can increase posts’ visibility and help you get noticed. Some communities require karma to post or comment, which helps prevent spam or low-quality content.\n\nReddit Premium:\n\nPurchase Reddit Premium to enjoy an ads-free experience and access to premium avatar gear, r/lounge, custom app icons, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis to your Apple account. Your monthly or annual Premium subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription ends. Cancel anytime in your device’s Account Settings. No partial refunds.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy \nUser Agreement: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement \nReddit Rules: https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules\n\nIf you have any problems with the app, get support at RedditHelp.com",

And if it DOES happen again, the app will clear any unnecessary notifications on the next Discord app launch.\n\nThe following issues have also been cleaned up: \n\n- Sharing multiple images to Discord via the Share Sheet should now preserve the order of images properly. \n\n- Fixed multi-image embeds only showing the last image, as if you only heard a joke’s punchline before the rest of it. \n\n- Resolved an issue where the Camera Flip button wouldn’t function properly... although it still doesn’t make your phone do a backflip. \n\nAs always, see what else we’ve been cookin’ (or, I guess, uncooked?) over at dis.gd/PatchNotes",

      "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "Mastodon is the best way to keep up with what’s happening. Follow anyone across the fediverse and see it all in chronological order. No algorithms, ads, or clickbait in sight.\n\nThis is the official iOS app for Mastodon. In our app, you can:\n\nEXPLORE\n\n■ Discover new writers, journalists, artists, photographers, scientists and more\n■ See what’s happening in the world\n\nREAD\n\n■ Keep up with people you care about in a chronological feed with no interruptions\n■ Follow hashtags to keep up with specific topics in real time\n\nCREATE\n\n■ Post to your followers or the whole world, with polls, high quality images and videos\n■ Participate in interesting conversations with other people\n\nCURATE\n\n■ Create lists of people to never miss a post\n■ Filter words or phrases to control what you do and don’t want to see\n\nAND MORE!\n\n■ Login and switch between multiple accounts\n■ No spoilers! You can put your posts behind content warnings\n\nA POWERFUL PUBLISHING PLATFORM\n\nYou no longer have to try and appease an opaque algorithm that decides if your friends are going to see what you posted. If they follow you, they’ll see it.\n\nIf you publish it to the open web, it’s accessible on the open web. You can safely share links to Mastodon in the knowledge that anyone will be able to read them without logging in.\n\nBetween threads, polls, high quality images, videos, audio, and content warnings, Mastodon offers plenty of ways to express yourself in a way that suits you.\n\nA POWERFUL READING PLATFORM\n\nWe don’t need to show you ads, so we don’t need to keep you in our app. Mastodon has the richest selection of 3rd party apps and integrations so you can choose the experience that fits you best. \n\nThanks to the chronological home feed, it’s easy to tell when you’ve caught up on all updates and can move on to something else.\n\nNo need to worry that a misclick will ruin your recommendations forever. We don’t guess what you want to see, we let you control it.\n\nPROTOCOLS, NOT PLATFORMS\n\nMastodon is not like a traditional social media platform, but is built on a decentralized protocol. You can sign up on our official server, or choose a 3rd party to host your data and moderate your experience.\n\nThanks to the common protocol, no matter what you choose, you can communicate seamlessly with people on other Mastodon servers. But there’s more: With just one account, you can communicate with people from other fediverse platforms.\n\nNot happy with your choice? You can always switch to a different Mastodon server while taking your followers with you. For advanced users, you can even host your data on your own infrastructure, since Mastodon is open-source.\n\nNON-PROFIT IN NATURE\n\nMastodon is a registered non-profit in the US and Germany. We are not motivated by extracting monetary value from the platform, but by what’s best for the platform.\n\nAS FEATURED IN: TIME, Forbes, Wired, The Guardian, CNN, The Verge, TechCrunch, Financial Times, Gizmodo, PCMAG.com, and more.",

        "description": "Mastodon is the best way to keep up with what’s happening. Follow anyone across the fediverse and see it all in chronological order. No algorithms, ads, or clickbait in sight.\n\nThis is the official iOS app for Mastodon. In our app, you can:\n\nEXPLORE\n\n■ Discover new writers, journalists, artists, photographers, scientists and more\n■ See what’s happening in the world\n\nREAD\n\n■ Keep up with people you care about in a chronological feed with no interruptions\n■ Follow hashtags to keep up with specific topics in real time\n\nCREATE\n\n■ Post to your followers or the whole world, with polls, high quality images and videos\n■ Participate in interesting conversations with other people\n\nCURATE\n\n■ Create lists of people to never miss a post\n■ Filter words or phrases to control what you do and don’t want to see\n\nAND MORE!\n\n■ Login and switch between multiple accounts\n■ No spoilers! You can put your posts behind content warnings\n\nA POWERFUL PUBLISHING PLATFORM\n\nYou no longer have to try and appease an opaque algorithm that decides if your friends are going to see what you posted. If they follow you, they’ll see it.\n\nIf you publish it to the open web, it’s accessible on the open web. You can safely share links to Mastodon in the knowledge that anyone will be able to read them without logging in.\n\nBetween threads, polls, high quality images, videos, audio, and content warnings, Mastodon offers plenty of ways to express yourself in a way that suits you.\n\nA POWERFUL READING PLATFORM\n\nWe don’t need to show you ads, so we don’t need to keep you in our app. Mastodon has the richest selection of 3rd party apps and integrations so you can choose the experience that fits you best. \n\nThanks to the chronological home feed, it’s easy to tell when you’ve caught up on all updates and can move on to something else.\n\nNo need to worry that a misclick will ruin your recommendations forever. We don’t guess what you want to see, we let you control it.\n\nPROTOCOLS, NOT PLATFORMS\n\nMastodon is not like a traditional social media platform, but is built on a decentralized protocol. You can sign up on our official server, or choose a 3rd party to host your data and moderate your experience.\n\nThanks to the common protocol, no matter what you choose, you can communicate seamlessly with people on other Mastodon servers. But there’s more: With just one account, you can communicate with people from other fediverse platforms.\n\nNot happy with your choice? You can always switch to a different Mastodon server while taking your followers with you. For advanced users, you can even host your data on your own infrastructure, since Mastodon is open-source.\n\nNON-PROFIT IN NATURE\n\nMastodon is a registered non-profit in the US and Germany. We are not motivated by extracting monetary value from the platform, but by what’s best for the platform.\n\nAS FEATURED IN: TIME, Forbes, Wired, The Guardian, CNN, The Verge, TechCrunch, Financial Times, Gizmodo, PCMAG.com, and more.",

The Popular Pays Agile Advertising Suite supports Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest. Use our app to browse, apply, create (and get paid for) your work. Brands of all sizes work with us – from Hyatt to Mother Raw (update this brand?) – and they’re looking for beautiful, engaging, and innovative content from Creators on social media.

The Popular Pays Agile Advertising Suite supports Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest. Use our app to browse, apply, create (and get paid for) your work. Brands of all sizes work with us – from Hyatt to Mother Raw (update this brand?) – and they’re looking for beautiful, engaging, and innovative content from Creators on social media.

VoxWeb is the harbinger of online communication and true blue-chip economy. \n\nIn one of the most patient and meticulous software development exercises ever taken, VoxWeb has been conceptualized, designed and developed to play at the intersection of social media, AI and fin-tech to revolutionize internet, economies and eventually lives of billions of people.\n\nThe current app version, despite being just the tip-of-iceberg, is a full-stack social media and messaging platform with a touch of AR through voice-augmented photos. Crucially and interestingly, the VoxWeb app has already been prepared to come with a refreshingly new and unprecedented feature every now and then over the period of at least next 4-5 years to radically change the way we communicate on internet! \n\nSpeaking of the current version and some design aspects of the current version, VoxWeb has a social media platform called LiFE and an in-app Messenger. \n\nHow LiFE has been designed\n\nLife is an auto bootstrapped \"Follower-Following\" network from phone-books and is developed on the premise that anything you put publicly on internet is out there forever and out of your control. So don’t take stress in managing post-specific control settings and go with the flow and excitement as you make one-to-many communication with people who are following your life and interested in your posts. \n\nMoreover, to completely remove the friction of so-called social media performance anxiety the \"Like\" button has been rationalized and REFORMED drastically. Now a user's followers and others on the platform cannot see the 'like count' and 'like list' on the user's posts. So a user is free to post captured moments, videos, albums and frequent LiFE updates without worrying about phony status symbols. \n\nAlso, introduced simplest and most effective Privacy Settings ever designed. Now manage your posts on the VoxWeb network with merely 2 privacy settings options! The new \"Stop\" feature enables silent blocking without interfering in any way with the fun and flexibility of a Follower-Following network's open nature and unilateral \"Followings\". \n\nSome facets of VoxWeb Messenger:\n\nVoxWeb Messenger is the foundation on which half a dozen game-changing original features will be introduced over time. As the world moves towards post-QWERTY internet, VoxWeb is all set to usher users through a combination of voice, augmented reality and mixed reality.",
