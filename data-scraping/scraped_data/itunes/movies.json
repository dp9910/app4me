      "description": "Upflix is a guide that helps you discover where your favorite movies and shows are available on the streaming platforms you already subscribe to.\n\nUpflix is great tool for keeping up with releases and discovering where to watch your favorite content on the largest streaming platforms.\n\nYour ultimate guide to movies and series on the major streaming services. If you're a subscriber to Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, Max, Hulu, or AppleTV, Upflix is perfect for you!\n\nWith such a massive combined catalog (Netflix alone has 5000 titles), it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Upflix offers a solution that will impress you and help you navigate more efficiently.\n  \n- Be the first to know:\nYou'll receive notifications about content added to the platforms. If Netflix adds a new episode of the series you're watching, you'll know. If Prime Video adds a new movie to its catalog, you'll know that too. Upflix will keep you informed firsthand about the latest movies and series. Did you know that Netflix now has \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\"?\n\n- User-friendly Guide:\nUpflix is a practical and simple guide. Everything is quick and straightforward, with no accounts or logins required. Just download and start using it. The only prerequisite is being a subscriber to Netflix or another streaming service that we support.\n\n- Expert Reviews:\nWith Upflix, you'll have access to reviews and ratings from specialized websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB, which will help you decide what to watch. If Netflix just released a series and you're not sure if it's good, just check Upflix!\n\n- Custom Lists:\nUpflix offers two different types of lists: a wishlist and a list of the series you're following. If you're watching \"The Witcher\" on Netflix and \"The Last of Us\" on Max, you can add both series and be notified whenever a new episode or season arrives. That way, you won't miss a thing.\n\n- Discover where to watch:\nNot sure on which platform your favorite movie or series is available? Our tool allows you to save time and find where to watch your favorite content. Did you know that \"Lord of The Rings\" is available on Netflix, Hulu, and Max? And that HBO's \"Ballers\" is on Netflix?

        "description": "Upflix is a guide that helps you discover where your favorite movies and shows are available on the streaming platforms you already subscribe to.\n\nUpflix is great tool for keeping up with releases and discovering where to watch your favorite content on the largest streaming platforms.\n\nYour ultimate guide to movies and series on the major streaming services. If you're a subscriber to Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, Max, Hulu, or AppleTV, Upflix is perfect for you!\n\nWith such a massive combined catalog (Netflix alone has 5000 titles), it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Upflix offers a solution that will impress you and help you navigate more efficiently.\n  \n- Be the first to know:\nYou'll receive notifications about content added to the platforms. If Netflix adds a new episode of the series you're watching, you'll know. If Prime Video adds a new movie to its catalog, you'll know that too. Upflix will keep you informed firsthand about the latest movies and series. Did you know that Netflix now has \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\"?\n\n- User-friendly Guide:\nUpflix is a practical and simple guide.

The only prerequisite is being a subscriber to Netflix or another streaming service that we support.\n\n- Expert Reviews:\nWith Upflix, you'll have access to reviews and ratings from specialized websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB, which will help you decide what to watch. If Netflix just released a series and you're not sure if it's good, just check Upflix!\n\n- Custom Lists:\nUpflix offers two different types of lists: a wishlist and a list of the series you're following. If you're watching \"The Witcher\" on Netflix and \"The Last of Us\" on Max, you can add both series and be notified whenever a new episode or season arrives. That way, you won't miss a thing.\n\n- Discover where to watch:\nNot sure on which platform your favorite movie or series is available?

How could hoichoi stay behind?\n\nConsider this our pujor jama. Same soul, sharper style, deeper roots. And just like a new outfit, we have stitched up the loose threads too. Here's what is proudly fixed:\n\nRefreshed UI for a smoother, more intuitive experience\n\nBug fixes to keep the app running seamlessly\n\nSo, whether it is smoother logins or smarter search, every corner of the app has had a polish. Unleash your inner Shankar to explore, channel your Feluda to observe, and be like Byomkesh. Make some cha and investigate.\n\nhoichoi: Boldly Bangali",

      "description": "This is the definitive movie tracker powered by Trakt.tv\n\n\nShowPal Movies is the best way to manage, discover and keep track of your movies. It's powered with Trakt so you can get all your up-to-date info synced in every device.\n\nWe have built a gesture driven interface so you can mark as watched, as favorite or even change the cover artwork with simple, intuitive finger gestures.\n\nWe don't want to bore you with the same interface, so you can customize the app by changing between two different layouts: Poster and Fanart. Hardcore users will love the condensed view option!\nOnce you have chosen the layout, you can customize the Poster and Fanart images with a simple swipe; browsing the images at full screen, and even save and share them.\n\nYou can also change the app's color scheme (Light and Dark) and choose from six different highlight colors.\nFinally, you can use the tinted option to enhance the app’s UI. You can even make ShowPal automatically look different every day!\n\nWhen you are in the mood for new movies, tap the add button to go to the Discovery area, where you can see our personal picks, trending and popular movies. If you're connected to Trakt.tv, you can also get recommendations based on your movies, as well as find out what movie your friends are watching.\n\nWe highly encourage you to create a Trakt.tv account; doing so will allow you to keep a backup of your watched history and also comment or rate your favorite movies. If you plan on using ShowPal both on your iPhone and your iPad, a Trakt.tv account is a must.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAnd remember that if you're also a TV Show addict, you can keep track of your favorite TV Shows with ShowPal TV!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This app is meant to keep track of your favorite movies. You CANNOT VIEW movies within this app.",

        "description": "This is the definitive movie tracker powered by Trakt.tv\n\n\nShowPal Movies is the best way to manage, discover and keep track of your movies. It's powered with Trakt so you can get all your up-to-date info synced in every device.\n\nWe have built a gesture driven interface so you can mark as watched, as favorite or even change the cover artwork with simple, intuitive finger gestures.\n\nWe don't want to bore you with the same interface, so you can customize the app by changing between two different layouts: Poster and Fanart. Hardcore users will love the condensed view option!\nOnce you have chosen the layout, you can customize the Poster and Fanart images with a simple swipe; browsing the images at full screen, and even save and share them.\n\nYou can also change the app's color scheme (Light and Dark) and choose from six different highlight colors.\nFinally, you can use the tinted option to enhance the app’s UI. You can even make ShowPal automatically look different every day!\n\nWhen you are in the mood for new movies, tap the add button to go to the Discovery area, where you can see our personal picks, trending and popular movies. If you're connected to Trakt.tv, you can also get recommendations based on your movies, as well as find out what movie your friends are watching.\n\nWe highly encourage you to create a Trakt.tv account; doing so will allow you to keep a backup of your watched history and also comment or rate your favorite movies. If you plan on using ShowPal both on your iPhone and your iPad, a Trakt.tv account is a must.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nAnd remember that if you're also a TV Show addict, you can keep track of your favorite TV Shows with ShowPal TV!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This app is meant to keep track of your favorite movies. You CANNOT VIEW movies within this app.",
