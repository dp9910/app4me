      "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

And if it DOES happen again, the app will clear any unnecessary notifications on the next Discord app launch.\n\nThe following issues have also been cleaned up: \n\n- Sharing multiple images to Discord via the Share Sheet should now preserve the order of images properly. \n\n- Fixed multi-image embeds only showing the last image, as if you only heard a joke’s punchline before the rest of it. \n\n- Resolved an issue where the Camera Flip button wouldn’t function properly... although it still doesn’t make your phone do a backflip. \n\nAs always, see what else we’ve been cookin’ (or, I guess, uncooked?) over at dis.gd/PatchNotes",

      "description": "Parents who are divorced, separated, or were never legally married use TalkingParents to manage all communication regarding their children. Whether your co-parenting situation is amicable or high conflict, our cutting-edge tools make joint custody easier to navigate, while keeping interactions saved to a court-admissible Record. TalkingParents is here to help you coordinate more seamlessly, set boundaries, and focus on what matters most: your children.\n \nSecure Messaging: Send messages that can’t be edited or deleted and easily organize them by topic. All messages and read receipts are timestamped, allowing you to see when your co-parent sent or viewed a message. \n\nAccountable Calling: Make phone and video calls, complete with recordings and transcripts, without ever having to share your phone number. \n\nShared Calendar: Manage custody schedules and your child’s appointments and activities all on a Shared Calendar that both parents can access. Create single events for things like doctor’s appointments and repeating events for your child’s extracurriculars and custody transition days. \n  \nAccountable Payments: Make payment requests and securely send or receive money, allowing you to keep track of all shared parenting expenses. Requests and payments are timestamped, and you can also schedule monthly recurring payments. \n\nInfo Library: Share important details about the kids with customizable cards that both parents can access without having to contact each other. This feature is a great place to store frequently used information like clothing sizes, medical information, and more. \n\nPersonal Journal: Keep private notes about thoughts and interactions you want recorded for later. Whether it’s in-person discussions with your co-parent or child behavior observances, journal entries are just for you and can include up to five attachments.  \n\nVault File Storage: Store photos, videos, and important documents. Your Vault cannot be accessed by your co-parent, but you may choose to share files with any third party by copying or emailing a link, which can be set to expire. You can also download files to your device. \n\nUnalterable Records: All interactions within TalkingParents are stored to Unalterable Records that are trusted by legal professionals and accepted in courtrooms nationwide. Each Record includes a Digital Signature and unique 16-digit Authentication Code that verifies the Record is genuine and has not been modified in any way. PDF and Printed Records are available for Secure Messaging, Accountable Calling, Shared Calendar, Accountable Payments, Info Library, and Personal Journal.  \n\n\nFAQs: \n\nDo I have to be on the same plan as my co-parent? \n\nNo, you can communicate through TalkingParents no matter what plan your co-parent is on. We offer four different plans—Free, Essentials, Enhanced, or Ultimate. (Free users do not have access to the mobile app.)\n \n\nIs TalkingParents court-monitored? \n\nNo, though Unalterable Records are court-admissible and can be used as evidence in family law cases, no one monitors interactions between you and your co-parent. This is for the privacy of our users. \n\n\n\nCan I change plans? \n\nYes, TalkingParents offers monthly subscriptions that make it easy to modify your plan at any time. If you don’t think your needs will change throughout the year, we also offer annual plans that include a 16% discount. \n\n\n\nCan my account be deleted?  \n\nNo, TalkingParents does not allow the deletion of accounts once created and matched. This ensures that neither co-parent can remove an account and clear messages, call records, or other details within the service. \n\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Parents who are divorced, separated, or were never legally married use TalkingParents to manage all communication regarding their children. Whether your co-parenting situation is amicable or high conflict, our cutting-edge tools make joint custody easier to navigate, while keeping interactions saved to a court-admissible Record. TalkingParents is here to help you coordinate more seamlessly, set boundaries, and focus on what matters most: your children.\n \nSecure Messaging: Send messages that can’t be edited or deleted and easily organize them by topic. All messages and read receipts are timestamped, allowing you to see when your co-parent sent or viewed a message. \n\nAccountable Calling: Make phone and video calls, complete with recordings and transcripts, without ever having to share your phone number. \n\nShared Calendar: Manage custody schedules and your child’s appointments and activities all on a Shared Calendar that both parents can access. Create single events for things like doctor’s appointments and repeating events for your child’s extracurriculars and custody transition days. \n  \nAccountable Payments: Make payment requests and securely send or receive money, allowing you to keep track of all shared parenting expenses. Requests and payments are timestamped, and you can also schedule monthly recurring payments. \n\nInfo Library: Share important details about the kids with customizable cards that both parents can access without having to contact each other. This feature is a great place to store frequently used information like clothing sizes, medical information, and more. \n\nPersonal Journal: Keep private notes about thoughts and interactions you want recorded for later. Whether it’s in-person discussions with your co-parent or child behavior observances, journal entries are just for you and can include up to five attachments.  \n\nVault File Storage: Store photos, videos, and important documents. Your Vault cannot be accessed by your co-parent, but you may choose to share files with any third party by copying or emailing a link, which can be set to expire. You can also download files to your device. \n\nUnalterable Records: All interactions within TalkingParents are stored to Unalterable Records that are trusted by legal professionals and accepted in courtrooms nationwide. Each Record includes a Digital Signature and unique 16-digit Authentication Code that verifies the Record is genuine and has not been modified in any way. PDF and Printed Records are available for Secure Messaging, Accountable Calling, Shared Calendar, Accountable Payments, Info Library, and Personal Journal.  \n\n\nFAQs: \n\nDo I have to be on the same plan as my co-parent? \n\nNo, you can communicate through TalkingParents no matter what plan your co-parent is on. We offer four different plans—Free, Essentials, Enhanced, or Ultimate. (Free users do not have access to the mobile app.)\n \n\nIs TalkingParents court-monitored? \n\nNo, though Unalterable Records are court-admissible and can be used as evidence in family law cases, no one monitors interactions between you and your co-parent. This is for the privacy of our users. \n\n\n\nCan I change plans? \n\nYes, TalkingParents offers monthly subscriptions that make it easy to modify your plan at any time. If you don’t think your needs will change throughout the year, we also offer annual plans that include a 16% discount. \n\n\n\nCan my account be deleted?  \n\nNo, TalkingParents does not allow the deletion of accounts once created and matched. This ensures that neither co-parent can remove an account and clear messages, call records, or other details within the service. \n\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "The refreshingly simple, and remarkably effective, project management platform.\n\nManaging people and projects under pressure is tough enough. Unfortunately, lots of software makes it worse by over-complicating things. Basecamp’s different.\n\nWhat makes Basecamp special?\n\nIt’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management.\n\nBasecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together.\n\nBasecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone.",

Klapp allows the transmission of messages and files in private messages or as a chat. School appointments and absence messages are clearly displayed in the calendar, which can also be synchronized with the local calendar app. Video conferencing is integrated into Klapp. Printed letters, chain telephones, information booklets, absence notification via phone and a clogged pinboard are a thing of the past.",

      "description": "OurFamilyWizard is the #1 co-parenting app trusted by courts and family law professionals across all 50 states in the US, as well as Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The app has been featured in the New York Times, Parents.com, Verywell Family, NPR, WIRED, the Today Show, and more.\n\nOurFamilyWizard makes co-parenting easier. We designed these tools to help you reduce conflict, so your kids can thrive after a separation or a divorce. With our powerful and customizable tools, you can free up time, emotional energy, and mental space.\n\nWith all your digital co-parenting interactions rolled up in one secure app, you can keep everything organized and documented. Plus, you can shield your kids from adult conversations they don’t need to see.\n\nNEW: STAY CONNECTED THROUGH CALLS\n\n• Stay close when you’re apart\n\nWhen you miss your child or they miss you, give them an audio or video call.\n\n• Connect virtually\n\nCalls offer an easy solution for virtual visitation, midweek visits, or long-distance co-parenting.\n\n*Currently, the calls feature is only available to users located in the United States.\n\n• Automatic documentation\n\nWith Calls, the details are documented: all dates, times, and in-call activity. All in the same place as your other co-parenting communications.\n\nSIMPLIFY COMMUNICATION\n\n• Use just one app\n\nNo more searching for messages or attachments across DMs, phone calls, texts, and emails. Just use one secure app.\n\n• Track the truth\n\nOnce you send a message, it’s permanent. First-viewed timestamps mean no more arguing about who said what, when, or whether it was seen.\n\n• Communicate calmly\n\nToneMeter AI catches language that could escalate conflict and offers suggestions on how to rewrite your message.\n\nCOORDINATE YOUR CALENDAR\n\n• Create a parenting time schedule (or custody schedule)\n\nThe color-coded schedule shows what’s coming up, including events, holidays, and drop-offs/pick-ups.\n\n• Encourage reliability\n\nWhen everyone shares the same Calendar, mix-ups are a thing of the past.\n\n• Schedule Change Requests\n\nNeed to make a one-time change to the schedule? Adjust the Calendar with an easy form.\n\nSTREAMLINE YOUR EXPENSES\n\n• Simplify the math\n\nKeep clear, secure records of your co-parenting expenses and receipts.\n\n• Customize categories\n\nCreate new categories, with your own percentage splits.\n\n• Centralize everything\n\nWith OFWpay, you can reimburse your co-parent in the app—and you can even make scheduled payments for child support. (Or record payments via another method.)\n\nKEEP A MEANINGFUL JOURNAL\n\n• Log when you arrive\n\nVerify your presence at drop-offs and pick-ups with GPS Check-Ins.\n\n• Capture memories\n\nRecord parenting observations and special, close moments with photos and text.\n\nSHARE INFO ABOUT YOUR KIDS\n\n• Store essential details\n\nShare and view medical records, clothing sizes, school information, and more.\n\n• Minimize messaging\n\nNo need to message your co-parent for basic stuff—just check the Info Bank.\n\nDOCUMENTATION AND REPORTS\n\nIf you need to go to court or mediation, quick and simple documentation will make your life easier. It only takes a couple minutes on the website to customize and download a report from any app feature.\n\nGRANT YOUR PROS ACCESS\n\nWith your permission and a Practitioner Account, your family law pro can view all app activity, help you manage the practical details, and quickly download reports—which potentially reduces your legal fees. Available for:\n\nLawyers\n\nMediators\n\nParenting coordinators\n\nGuardians ad litem\n\nTherapists\n\nKEEP EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE\n\nOurFamilyWizard helps you coordinate with your co-parent, but you can also add accounts for your kids and anyone involved in childcare. (These accounts can only view limited features.)\n\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS?\n\nOur customer service and tech support are available 7 days a week—contact us via phone, chat, or email. We’d love to help.\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "OurFamilyWizard is the #1 co-parenting app trusted by courts and family law professionals across all 50 states in the US, as well as Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The app has been featured in the New York Times, Parents.com, Verywell Family, NPR, WIRED, the Today Show, and more.\n\nOurFamilyWizard makes co-parenting easier. We designed these tools to help you reduce conflict, so your kids can thrive after a separation or a divorce. With our powerful and customizable tools, you can free up time, emotional energy, and mental space.\n\nWith all your digital co-parenting interactions rolled up in one secure app, you can keep everything organized and documented. Plus, you can shield your kids from adult conversations they don’t need to see.\n\nNEW: STAY CONNECTED THROUGH CALLS\n\n• Stay close when you’re apart\n\nWhen you miss your child or they miss you, give them an audio or video call.\n\n• Connect virtually\n\nCalls offer an easy solution for virtual visitation, midweek visits, or long-distance co-parenting.\n\n*Currently, the calls feature is only available to users located in the United States.\n\n• Automatic documentation\n\nWith Calls, the details are documented: all dates, times, and in-call activity. All in the same place as your other co-parenting communications.\n\nSIMPLIFY COMMUNICATION\n\n• Use just one app\n\nNo more searching for messages or attachments across DMs, phone calls, texts, and emails. Just use one secure app.\n\n• Track the truth\n\nOnce you send a message, it’s permanent. First-viewed timestamps mean no more arguing about who said what, when, or whether it was seen.\n\n• Communicate calmly\n\nToneMeter AI catches language that could escalate conflict and offers suggestions on how to rewrite your message.\n\nCOORDINATE YOUR CALENDAR\n\n• Create a parenting time schedule (or custody schedule)\n\nThe color-coded schedule shows what’s coming up, including events, holidays, and drop-offs/pick-ups.\n\n• Encourage reliability\n\nWhen everyone shares the same Calendar, mix-ups are a thing of the past.\n\n• Schedule Change Requests\n\nNeed to make a one-time change to the schedule? Adjust the Calendar with an easy form.\n\nSTREAMLINE YOUR EXPENSES\n\n• Simplify the math\n\nKeep clear, secure records of your co-parenting expenses and receipts.\n\n• Customize categories\n\nCreate new categories, with your own percentage splits.\n\n• Centralize everything\n\nWith OFWpay, you can reimburse your co-parent in the app—and you can even make scheduled payments for child support. (Or record payments via another method.)\n\nKEEP A MEANINGFUL JOURNAL\n\n• Log when you arrive\n\nVerify your presence at drop-offs and pick-ups with GPS Check-Ins.\n\n• Capture memories\n\nRecord parenting observations and special, close moments with photos and text.\n\nSHARE INFO ABOUT YOUR KIDS\n\n• Store essential details\n\nShare and view medical records, clothing sizes, school information, and more.\n\n• Minimize messaging\n\nNo need to message your co-parent for basic stuff—just check the Info Bank.\n\nDOCUMENTATION AND REPORTS\n\nIf you need to go to court or mediation, quick and simple documentation will make your life easier. It only takes a couple minutes on the website to customize and download a report from any app feature.\n\nGRANT YOUR PROS ACCESS\n\nWith your permission and a Practitioner Account, your family law pro can view all app activity, help you manage the practical details, and quickly download reports—which potentially reduces your legal fees. Available for:\n\nLawyers\n\nMediators\n\nParenting coordinators\n\nGuardians ad litem\n\nTherapists\n\nKEEP EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE\n\nOurFamilyWizard helps you coordinate with your co-parent, but you can also add accounts for your kids and anyone involved in childcare. (These accounts can only view limited features.)\n\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS?\n\nOur customer service and tech support are available 7 days a week—contact us via phone, chat, or email. We’d love to help.\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "During the most critical moments in life, Pulsara® places the power in your hands to build teams and communicate with public safety, public health, and emergency management on the fly. Pulsara unites distributed teams—first responders, emergency medical services, fire departments, hospitals, health systems, behavioral health experts, emergency management, and more—on one scalable communication and logistics platform. From the routine EMS transport to a mass casualty incident, Pulsara’s flexible platform enables teams to standardize workflows and streamline communications for every method of arrival and patient or event type. The result? Decreased treatment times, providers who are empowered to provide better quality of care, reduced provider burnout, and cost and resource savings.\n\nIn an age when smartphones and mobile technology are used for just about everything, many health systems rely on fax machines, pagers, two-way radios, landline phone calls, and even sticky notes to coordinate patient care. Vital information often falls through the cracks, leading to wasted resources, delayed treatments, decreased quality of care, and billions of dollars lost annually due to medical errors.\n\nUnlike other solutions that only connect people within the four walls of their own facility or organization, Pulsara can connect ANYONE from ANYWHERE for ANY condition or event, enabling true systems of care that scale. Purpose-built to improve the lives of people in need and those who serve them, Pulsara streamlines all logistics and communication around patient events.\n\nSimply CREATE a dedicated patient channel. BUILD the team. And COMMUNICATE & TRACK using audio, live video, instant messaging, data, images, and key benchmarks, all using the devices you and your teams know and love. You can add a new organization, team, or individual to any encounter, dynamically building a care team as the patient condition and location evolve. And when disaster strikes, Pulsara scales to manage incidents and events, allowing your teams to use the same familiar platform to respond to major incidents the same way they would a routine call. No matter what the situation is, Pulsara connects the right people at the right time, around every patient.\n\nAt Pulsara, we live by the phrase “It’s About People.” We see our customers as partners in a journey committed to improving the lives of every person they serve. By leveraging innovative communication features through the Pulsara platform, customers across the globe have improved patient outcomes, including:\n\n* In Texas, a hospital decreased the time it takes for stroke patients to receive tPA by 59%, dropping from an average of 110 minutes to 46 minutes\n\n* In an Australian health system, the ambulance routinely bypasses the emergency department to take patients directly to CT in 7 minutes on average, down 68% from a 22-minute average\n\n* A health system in Arkansas treated STEMI patients in an average of 63 minutes, a 19% decrease in just 4 months\n\n* An EMS agency in Texas used Pulsara to power their ET3 program and in just 3 weeks, prevented 434 low-acuity patients from needing to go to the hospital\n\n* An EMS agency in Texas reported that when using Pulsara for a full-scale crisis exercise, they had 100% accountability for all patients transported\n\nConnected teams have the power to achieve incredible results by bringing the focus back to what matters most: people.\n\n==================================\n\nPULSARA®  is a registered trademark and service mark of CommuniCare Technology, Inc. d/b/a Pulsara in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOFFICIAL FDA INTENDED USE STATEMENT\nThe Pulsara applications are intended to facilitate communication for and accelerate preparation of acute care coordination. The applications are not intended to be relied upon for making diagnostic or treatment decisions or used in connection with monitoring a patient.",

        "description": "During the most critical moments in life, Pulsara® places the power in your hands to build teams and communicate with public safety, public health, and emergency management on the fly. Pulsara unites distributed teams—first responders, emergency medical services, fire departments, hospitals, health systems, behavioral health experts, emergency management, and more—on one scalable communication and logistics platform. From the routine EMS transport to a mass casualty incident, Pulsara’s flexible platform enables teams to standardize workflows and streamline communications for every method of arrival and patient or event type. The result? Decreased treatment times, providers who are empowered to provide better quality of care, reduced provider burnout, and cost and resource savings.\n\nIn an age when smartphones and mobile technology are used for just about everything, many health systems rely on fax machines, pagers, two-way radios, landline phone calls, and even sticky notes to coordinate patient care. Vital information often falls through the cracks, leading to wasted resources, delayed treatments, decreased quality of care, and billions of dollars lost annually due to medical errors.\n\nUnlike other solutions that only connect people within the four walls of their own facility or organization, Pulsara can connect ANYONE from ANYWHERE for ANY condition or event, enabling true systems of care that scale. Purpose-built to improve the lives of people in need and those who serve them, Pulsara streamlines all logistics and communication around patient events.\n\nSimply CREATE a dedicated patient channel. BUILD the team. And COMMUNICATE & TRACK using audio, live video, instant messaging, data, images, and key benchmarks, all using the devices you and your teams know and love. You can add a new organization, team, or individual to any encounter, dynamically building a care team as the patient condition and location evolve. And when disaster strikes, Pulsara scales to manage incidents and events, allowing your teams to use the same familiar platform to respond to major incidents the same way they would a routine call. No matter what the situation is, Pulsara connects the right people at the right time, around every patient.\n\nAt Pulsara, we live by the phrase “It’s About People.” We see our customers as partners in a journey committed to improving the lives of every person they serve. By leveraging innovative communication features through the Pulsara platform, customers across the globe have improved patient outcomes, including:\n\n* In Texas, a hospital decreased the time it takes for stroke patients to receive tPA by 59%, dropping from an average of 110 minutes to 46 minutes\n\n* In an Australian health system, the ambulance routinely bypasses the emergency department to take patients directly to CT in 7 minutes on average, down 68% from a 22-minute average\n\n* A health system in Arkansas treated STEMI patients in an average of 63 minutes, a 19% decrease in just 4 months\n\n* An EMS agency in Texas used Pulsara to power their ET3 program and in just 3 weeks, prevented 434 low-acuity patients from needing to go to the hospital\n\n* An EMS agency in Texas reported that when using Pulsara for a full-scale crisis exercise, they had 100% accountability for all patients transported\n\nConnected teams have the power to achieve incredible results by bringing the focus back to what matters most: people.\n\n==================================\n\nPULSARA®  is a registered trademark and service mark of CommuniCare Technology, Inc. d/b/a Pulsara in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nOFFICIAL FDA INTENDED USE STATEMENT\nThe Pulsara applications are intended to facilitate communication for and accelerate preparation of acute care coordination. The applications are not intended to be relied upon for making diagnostic or treatment decisions or used in connection with monitoring a patient.",

        "description": "Weave Chat AAC is a free, dynamic, and completely customizable AAC app that is available to a variety of devices.\n\nWeave Chat AAC offers a large variety of verbs (green), pronouns (yellow), questions (purple), nouns (tan/orange), adjectives (blue), and conversational words (pink). All color choices were made based on the Fitzgerald Key and new vocabulary is added weekly.\n\nUsers can add their own custom images and categories in Settings —> Manage Custom Images.\n\nIn addition, users can add their own custom phrases that can easily be accessed from their board; to add phrases, go to Settings —> Manage Phrases. \n\nUsers can select a synthetic voice (dependent on their device settings) from Settings —> Change Voice Settings - here you can select your voice, vocal pitch, and rate of speech.\n\nImage and text size can be personalized from Settings —> Change Image & Text Size (select from default - small, medium, and large). Settings —> Configure Image Keyboard allows the user to turn on/off features that allow for the category text to be read aloud (synthetic voice for categories), to keep the user in the category after a image has been selected (stay on category after image selection), and disable the speech output for individual words so that it only reads aloud when the white text screen is touched (synthetic voice disabled for individual words). \n\nThe AAC board can be modified in Settings —> Manage Board Builder. Here, the user can select from the default board (you must make a copy to edit it - to do this select “Add new keyboard” and then select “Hide Images” for Type of Keyboard); grid position boards (ranging in size from 1x2 - 7x15 rows/columns); and Board Builder (gives you the option to build a board from scratch). All boards are completely editable and all custom images and categories can be used from all boards.\n\nLastly, Manage Pin Configuration allows the user to set a pin over all (or just some) aspects of customization to lock down features as needed.\n\nFeature List:\n- Dynamic, customizable, AAC boards\n- Large variety of verbs, nouns, and adjectives with additional vocabulary added weekly\n- Add custom images and custom categories\n- Create and save phrases\n- Select a synthetic voice (as available per your device settings)\n- Copy & Paste AAC picture icon messages via “share”\n- Create and/or modify AAC boards via 3 options: grid position boards (ranging from 1x2 - 7x15), hide images, and/or create a new board from scratch\n- “Text” others who have the app using AAC picture icons\n- Set a passcode to lock down features as needed\n- Weave Chat AAC currently only has English buttons/images",

      "description": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are exhausting. It doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nAt GroupSpot, we’ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single solution, whether it’s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won’t find a platform with more flexibility and efficiency than GroupSpot.\n\nHere’s a few groups using GroupSpot today:\n\nFamilies\nShare meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad’s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you’re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries.\n \n\nCommunity Groups\nBe a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it’s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.\n\nBook Clubs\nUnlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot’s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We’ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.\n\nTeams\nWe provide all the bells and whistles you’ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.\n\nFaith Groups\nMake your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.\n\nGroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: \n\n• Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts\n• Personal and Group Chat\n• Shared Photo Albums\n• Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments\n• Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams\n• Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs\n• Advanced Member Management\n• Subgroups and Sister Group Management\n\nAnd much more…\n\nAbout GroupSpot\nGroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you’ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there’s no incentive to mine someone’s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.\n\nWe’ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.\n\nPlease view the Terms of Service (EULA) here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nGroupSpot",

This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups.\n\nBook Clubs\nUnlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot’s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We’ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club.\n\nTeams\nWe provide all the bells and whistles you’ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands.\n\nFaith Groups\nMake your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more.\n\nGroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: \n\n• Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts\n• Personal and Group Chat\n• Shared Photo Albums\n• Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments\n• Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams\n• Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs\n• Advanced Member Management\n• Subgroups and Sister Group Management\n\nAnd much more…\n\nAbout GroupSpot\nGroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you’ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there’s no incentive to mine someone’s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy.\n\nWe’ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.\n\nPlease view the Terms of Service (EULA) here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nGroupSpot",

      "description": "Learn Communication Skills\nA decade-and-a-half later, with the rise of social media networking and texting, communication is becoming more casual, even in situations where more formal ways of communicating are required. What this means is that people from the younger generation, may not know or even understand the importance of effective communication skills in the workplace. When you take a look at the greatest leaders, one of the traits they possess, is the ability to communicate effectively, which underscores the importance of communication skills.\nAlpha Z Studio provides you communication skills app in which you will learn how to communicate with people in a good way. More details are given below.\n\ntypes of communication\nYour communication skills will fall under four categories of communication. Let's take a closer look at each area.\n\n1. Written communication\nWriting is one of the more traditional aspects of communication. We often write as part of our job, communicating via email and messenger apps like Slack, as well as in more formal documents, like project reports and white papers.\n\nConveying information clearly, concisely, and with an accurate tone of voice are all important parts of written communication.\n\n2. Verbal communication\nCommunicating verbally is how many of us share information in the workplace. This can be informal, such as chatting with coworkers about an upcoming deliverable, or more formal, such as meeting with your manager to discuss your performance.\n\n3. Non-verbal communication\nThe messages you communicate to others can also take place non-verbally—through your body language, eye contact, and overall demeanor. You can cultivate strong non-verbal communication by using appropriate facial expressions, nodding, and making good eye contact. Really, verbal communication and body language must be in sync to convey a message clearly.\n\n4. Visual communication\nLastly, visual communication means using images, graphs, charts, and other non-written means to share information. Often, visuals may accompany a piece of writing or stand alone. In either case, it's a good idea to make sure your visuals are clear and strengthen what you're sharing.\n\nWhy Is Effective Communication Important?\nEffective communication is vital both in and out of the workplace because it allows you to clearly translate your intentions and feelings into easily understandable messages. Effective communication makes you a more productive worker and cuts down on unintended consequences that arise as a result of miscommunication. Developing an effective communication process helps you understand what others are saying and makes you a better collaborator and team member.\n\nDeveloping advanced communication skills begins with simple interactions. Communication skills can be practiced every day in settings that range from the social to the professional. New skills take time to refine, but each time you use your communication skills, you open yourself to opportunities and future partnerships.\n\nIf you like our app then please give us 5 star ratings. we are trying our best to make the learning process more easy and simple for you.",

        "description": "Learn Communication Skills\nA decade-and-a-half later, with the rise of social media networking and texting, communication is becoming more casual, even in situations where more formal ways of communicating are required. What this means is that people from the younger generation, may not know or even understand the importance of effective communication skills in the workplace. When you take a look at the greatest leaders, one of the traits they possess, is the ability to communicate effectively, which underscores the importance of communication skills.\nAlpha Z Studio provides you communication skills app in which you will learn how to communicate with people in a good way. More details are given below.\n\ntypes of communication\nYour communication skills will fall under four categories of communication. Let's take a closer look at each area.\n\n1. Written communication\nWriting is one of the more traditional aspects of communication. We often write as part of our job, communicating via email and messenger apps like Slack, as well as in more formal documents, like project reports and white papers.\n\nConveying information clearly, concisely, and with an accurate tone of voice are all important parts of written communication.\n\n2. Verbal communication\nCommunicating verbally is how many of us share information in the workplace. This can be informal, such as chatting with coworkers about an upcoming deliverable, or more formal, such as meeting with your manager to discuss your performance.\n\n3. Non-verbal communication\nThe messages you communicate to others can also take place non-verbally—through your body language, eye contact, and overall demeanor. You can cultivate strong non-verbal communication by using appropriate facial expressions, nodding, and making good eye contact. Really, verbal communication and body language must be in sync to convey a message clearly.\n\n4. Visual communication\nLastly, visual communication means using images, graphs, charts, and other non-written means to share information. Often, visuals may accompany a piece of writing or stand alone. In either case, it's a good idea to make sure your visuals are clear and strengthen what you're sharing.\n\nWhy Is Effective Communication Important?\nEffective communication is vital both in and out of the workplace because it allows you to clearly translate your intentions and feelings into easily understandable messages. Effective communication makes you a more productive worker and cuts down on unintended consequences that arise as a result of miscommunication. Developing an effective communication process helps you understand what others are saying and makes you a better collaborator and team member.\n\nDeveloping advanced communication skills begins with simple interactions. Communication skills can be practiced every day in settings that range from the social to the professional. New skills take time to refine, but each time you use your communication skills, you open yourself to opportunities and future partnerships.\n\nIf you like our app then please give us 5 star ratings. we are trying our best to make the learning process more easy and simple for you.",

      "description": "Do you need speech training for an interview, a sales pitch, a presentation, a party, or even a relationship talk? Question Roulette provides a concrete, effective way to work on your public speaking skills. This innovative communication skills training app helps you practice and track your improvement.\n\nHow the Question Roulette App works:\n- Question Roulette lets you answer difficult questions or objections, with topics like general business, relationships, self-reflection, cocktail party banter, and many other public speaking situations. \n- Record your answer and listen to how you did. You can also read a transcript of your response, very useful for interview training.\n- Get immediate, concrete feedback on: time speaking, amount and type of filler language, and pace of speech. \n- Save your best recordings, rate yourself with self-assessments, and track your improvement.\n- Share your best responses and get feedback from colleagues or friends, to take your speech training to the next level.\n\nAnswering tough questions is great for overall communications training. Examples include:\n• “You’re not qualified for this position.”\n• “What do you want to do with your life?”\n• “Where is this relationship going?”\n\nPracticing out loud is the best way to prepare for an interview or presentation, and our interview questions training app makes it easy and fun. Improve your performance and build confidence before you ever get in the room.\n\nYou can experience this interview training app in three different modes: choose the objection yourself, get one roulette question asked randomly with time to warm up, or get one question at random and start speaking immediately.\n\nChoose Question:\nIn the “Choose Category” screen, you can pick a topic area and then choose a question you want to practice answering for interview questions training. You can see default questions or ones you’ve created yourself (if you own a “Group Account”).\n\nRoulette Mode:\nThis allows you to practice answering questions one after another, great for developing public speaking skills. In this mode, the app prompts you with a random question. You can think, prepare yourself, and start answering the roulette questions when you feel ready.\n\nRapid Fire:\nThe Rapid Fire mode challenges you to answer questions without having the time to prepare a response, which is excellent for interview skills training. In this mode, the app chooses a question at random for you, and you need to begin answering it when the three-second countdown ends.\n\nMetrics for Recorded Answers:\nOnce you record an answer, Question Roulette creates a transcript and shows data about your response, such as time speaking, filler language used, and words per second. Our interview training app will give you concrete feedback on your answer and suggest tips and videos to help you improve your speaking skills.\n\nSelf-Assessment and Feedback:\nAfter you review your answer and do a self-assessment, you can delete or replay your recording, as well as save it for future reference. If you want to get feedback on your answers from other users, you can share it. Both the self-assessment and feedback are rated from 1 to 5 stars.\n\nIn-App Purchases:\nYou can purchase the Exclusive World and unlock more questions in our roulette questions app. You’ll get exclusive access to 25+ additional questions related to job interviews, start-ups, and entrepreneurship!\n\nDownload the Question Roulette App and start speech training today to improve your communication skills!\n\nEULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Do you need speech training for an interview, a sales pitch, a presentation, a party, or even a relationship talk? Question Roulette provides a concrete, effective way to work on your public speaking skills. This innovative communication skills training app helps you practice and track your improvement.\n\nHow the Question Roulette App works:\n- Question Roulette lets you answer difficult questions or objections, with topics like general business, relationships, self-reflection, cocktail party banter, and many other public speaking situations. \n- Record your answer and listen to how you did. You can also read a transcript of your response, very useful for interview training.\n- Get immediate, concrete feedback on: time speaking, amount and type of filler language, and pace of speech. \n- Save your best recordings, rate yourself with self-assessments, and track your improvement.\n- Share your best responses and get feedback from colleagues or friends, to take your speech training to the next level.\n\nAnswering tough questions is great for overall communications training. Examples include:\n• “You’re not qualified for this position.”\n• “What do you want to do with your life?”\n• “Where is this relationship going?”\n\nPracticing out loud is the best way to prepare for an interview or presentation, and our interview questions training app makes it easy and fun. Improve your performance and build confidence before you ever get in the room.\n\nYou can experience this interview training app in three different modes: choose the objection yourself, get one roulette question asked randomly with time to warm up, or get one question at random and start speaking immediately.\n\nChoose Question:\nIn the “Choose Category” screen, you can pick a topic area and then choose a question you want to practice answering for interview questions training. You can see default questions or ones you’ve created yourself (if you own a “Group Account”).\n\nRoulette Mode:\nThis allows you to practice answering questions one after another, great for developing public speaking skills. In this mode, the app prompts you with a random question. You can think, prepare yourself, and start answering the roulette questions when you feel ready.\n\nRapid Fire:\nThe Rapid Fire mode challenges you to answer questions without having the time to prepare a response, which is excellent for interview skills training. In this mode, the app chooses a question at random for you, and you need to begin answering it when the three-second countdown ends.\n\nMetrics for Recorded Answers:\nOnce you record an answer, Question Roulette creates a transcript and shows data about your response, such as time speaking, filler language used, and words per second. Our interview training app will give you concrete feedback on your answer and suggest tips and videos to help you improve your speaking skills.\n\nSelf-Assessment and Feedback:\nAfter you review your answer and do a self-assessment, you can delete or replay your recording, as well as save it for future reference. If you want to get feedback on your answers from other users, you can share it. Both the self-assessment and feedback are rated from 1 to 5 stars.\n\nIn-App Purchases:\nYou can purchase the Exclusive World and unlock more questions in our roulette questions app. You’ll get exclusive access to 25+ additional questions related to job interviews, start-ups, and entrepreneurship!\n\nDownload the Question Roulette App and start speech training today to improve your communication skills!\n\nEULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively. You can also connect directly with our community of parents, professionals, and users on our Facebook groups. If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available as an in-app purchase (English only).\n\nIn order to use Proloquo2Go on Apple Watch, it must be paired with an iPhone.",

        "description": "Tap images. Type words. Speak. Proloquo2Go is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. Featuring natural sounding voices, including real children’s voices, Proloquo2Go is a simple yet powerful AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) tool. The app is fully customizable and can be utilized to build language skills and grow with a person’s communication, supporting both beginning and advanced communicators.\n\nParents, therapists, teachers and users around the world recognize Proloquo2Go as the gold standard in AAC solutions. The app is used by people with autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Angelman syndrome, and others with speech difficulties. The app is available in English, Spanish, French, and Dutch and supports bilingual use, so you can switch languages on the fly.\n\nProloquo2Go in action:\n\nLearn and grow\n\nStudies show that just 200-400 words make up 80% of what we say. Known as core words, they act as the basis of Proloquo2Go’s research-based Crescendo™ vocabulary. Users can grow from single words to full sentences in the same app. Crescendo puts core words in consistent locations for easy access and motor-planning. The vocabulary works with AAC best practices like modeling (where you use an AAC system to talk with the user) to develop language skills. Crescendo offers no limit on language development with a 10,000+ fringe word vocabulary and customizable vocabulary levels. Finally, with Progressive Language, words are gradually revealed step-by-step, helping users learn words and their location as their communication expands.\n\nEasy editing\n\nCustomizing Proloquo2Go is a breeze! Quickly and easily add new words. Use the app’s built-in library of 25,000 symbols or use your own photos by taking pictures within the app or selecting them from your photo library. For users with fine-motor challenges and vision impairments, Proloquo2Go offers options like 23 pre-programmed grid sizes and accessibility settings which support switch scanning and Apple’s VoiceOver screen reader. Everything from appearance to access is customizable so you can make it your own. \n\nType and speak\n\nBesides tapping images, Proloquo2Go also lets you type what you want to say. The app includes a Grid Keyboard arranged alphabetically for people learning to type. For more experienced typists, Proloquo2Go includes a Typing View with a QWERTY keyboard and word prediction that offers suggestions based on what you are typing. \n\nHello! ¡Hola! Bonjour! Hallo!\n\nProloquo2Go lets you select a language and region for the Crescendo vocabulary. Two languages can be used at the same time, allowing seamless bilingual speech. Over 100 included downloadable natural-sounding adult and children’s voices rounds out your choices to use the app your way.\n\nA helping hand\n\nAssistiveWare is here for you every step of the way. Help articles in Proloquo2Go are there whenever you need them. New to AAC? Our website has easy to understand articles in the Learn AAC section, and the AssistiveWare Core Word Classroom includes activities for teaching communication effectively. You can also connect directly with our community of parents, professionals, and users on our Facebook groups. If you have any questions, our support team is available 7 days a week and is always happy to help. All of these online resources can be accessed by going to the AssistiveWare website. \n\nNote: Discounts are available through Apple’s Educational Volume Purchase Program – 50% off on 20 licenses or more. Joan Bruno’s Gateway to Language & Learning© vocabulary is available as an in-app purchase (English only).\n\nIn order to use Proloquo2Go on Apple Watch, it must be paired with an iPhone.",

      "description": "Olvid is the first private instant messaging application for everyone.\n\nWhat is a \"private\" messenger?\n\nIt's a messenger:\n\n- That does not push new contacts on you. You are in control: you choose who you want to discuss with. Olvid offers several ways to invite other Olvid users, either face-to-face or remotely.\n\n- That does not require any personal data. Olvid won't ask for your phone number, for your email. Unlike your previous messenger, Olvid will never request access to your address book.\n\n- On which you will never receive unsolicited messages or messages from an unknown source.\n\n- Where all exchanges benefit from the same security and privacy as a real-world discussion behind closed doors. Olvid offers end-to-end encryption and end-to-end authentication by default, always, for everything you send or receive.\n\n\nOlvid guarantees you safe spaces, immune to external aggression, which isolate you from the digital noise and violence of other social networks. Create groups with your family, friends and key collaborators. No spam, no advertising. You finally regain full control over your communications.\n\nOlvid has been designed to be the best place to exchange on subjects that matter, with those who matter to you.\n\n\nOlvid - Technology\n------------------\n\nAt the heart of Olvid, a 'cryptographic engine' coming from several years of research allows to mathematically prove the authenticity, the integrity, and the confidentiality of your communications.",

        "description": "Olvid is the first private instant messaging application for everyone.\n\nWhat is a \"private\" messenger?\n\nIt's a messenger:\n\n- That does not push new contacts on you. You are in control: you choose who you want to discuss with. Olvid offers several ways to invite other Olvid users, either face-to-face or remotely.\n\n- That does not require any personal data. Olvid won't ask for your phone number, for your email. Unlike your previous messenger, Olvid will never request access to your address book.\n\n- On which you will never receive unsolicited messages or messages from an unknown source.\n\n- Where all exchanges benefit from the same security and privacy as a real-world discussion behind closed doors. Olvid offers end-to-end encryption and end-to-end authentication by default, always, for everything you send or receive.\n\n\nOlvid guarantees you safe spaces, immune to external aggression, which isolate you from the digital noise and violence of other social networks. Create groups with your family, friends and key collaborators. No spam, no advertising. You finally regain full control over your communications.\n\nOlvid has been designed to be the best place to exchange on subjects that matter, with those who matter to you.\n\n\nOlvid - Technology\n------------------\n\nAt the heart of Olvid, a 'cryptographic engine' coming from several years of research allows to mathematically prove the authenticity, the integrity, and the confidentiality of your communications.",

      "description": "Having great communication skills makes a difference—your patients will understand their medical situation better, build trust with you faster, and you will be able to guide them to medical decisions that match their values.\n\nThis app helps improve your communication skills with patients experiencing serious illness and their family members. Each tip can be utilized for your specific discipline and subspecialty. For clinicians in hospital medicine, oncology, cardiology, social work, nephrology, hepatology, chaplains, neurology, trauma, emergency medicine, primary care, pediatrics, palliative care and more. This app is made for you!\n\nWe've complied the research and curated a special set of communication skill tips, focused on the moments where clinicians most often get stuck. Flip through the tips by topic (serious news, prognosis, family conferences, goals of care, and more), or just get a daily tip as a notification. Read the tip (it'll take less than 10 seconds), try it out, and over time, your practice will improve.",

Each tip can be utilized for your specific discipline and subspecialty. For clinicians in hospital medicine, oncology, cardiology, social work, nephrology, hepatology, chaplains, neurology, trauma, emergency medicine, primary care, pediatrics, palliative care and more. This app is made for you!\n\nWe've complied the research and curated a special set of communication skill tips, focused on the moments where clinicians most often get stuck. Flip through the tips by topic (serious news, prognosis, family conferences, goals of care, and more), or just get a daily tip as a notification. Read the tip (it'll take less than 10 seconds), try it out, and over time, your practice will improve.",

      "description": "“I think image2talk is an easy to use and simple system that could be used successfully  by children and adults with emerging language skills. The instant feedback and the visual nature of the system will help in reducing communication frustration.”\nClaudine Ivers, Senior Speech and Language Therapist\n\nimage2talk is a simple to use, effective and fully customizable app that enables communication for individuals with whom verbal speech is impaired.\n\nWhether an individual is having difficulty communicating due to autism, stroke or any other communication disorder, image2talk can give that individual the ability to express themselves through the use of images, text and speaker output.  \n\nSuitable for adults and children, straightforward and adaptable customization within image2talk allows for the creation a personal communication tool.\n\nUnique to image2talk is that it completely eliminates the effort of having to navigate through menu or category pages. image2talk is based on the professional experiences of Fiona Wilson, a teacher working with students on the autism spectrum also presenting with general learning disabilities. \n\n“My brother-in-law was an attorney. A massive stroke stole his words. Losing his words was devastating. Showing him how image2talk worked, including family pictures with names, he touched picture after picture - repeating the word or phrase perfectly. He was never able to remember how to say his wife's or his grandchildrens' names until he had this tool? I added a picture of a heart, typing \"I LOVE YOU\" for it, shortened the time and now he can say, \"I love you, Elaine\"!!!  Do you know what a GIFT that is? ”\nJudi Smolin, USA\n\n“My daughter is 20 yrs old, moderate/severe Autism and though she can not talk, she does understand what is said to her verbally. She loves the REAL pictures. What I love about the Image2talk App is that it is so EASY to use, easy to change or add pictures, and the voice output is so clearly understood!”\nMichele Skoog, Radcliff KY (USA)\n\n* Tap and make images talk\n- tap the image - e.g. tap an orange\n- the image shows - see an orange on the screen\n- speaker output emits response - 'I want an orange'\n\n*Combine standard imagery with your own images\nCreate your own rows by deleting or reordering standard imagery.  Add your own images via the Camera roll.  Import rows from the gallery or your Dropbox folder.  If required, start off small and build up number of rows and images over time\n\n* Effective time delay - No need to press a back button\nTap an image, image enlarges and after a set time delay the basic overview screen will reappear. If appropriate, the time delay can be increased to give users opportunities to develop speaker and reader skills.\n\n*Features from image2talk\n- Tap image – it enlarges and speaks\n- Simple overview screen eliminating the need to navigate through category and menu pages\n- Basic default rows like food, feelings, etc\t\t\n- Easily customize image2talk at source to meet individual needs\n- Select gender and accent of voice\n- Available in English, Dutch, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese and Korean\n- Full library available in Dutch and French\n- Any text entered can be generated as spoken text\n- Import images from Cameral roll\n- Save images from the internet, computer or regular camera and import from Dropbox\n- Set time delay for basic overview screen to reappear\n- Turn text labels on/off\n- Turn voice on/off\n- Set a PIN to settings to prevent unwanted changes\n\nFiona Wilson has been teaching students with special needs for over 8 years and prior this taught in mainstream primary schools in Scotland and Ireland.",

        "description": "“I think image2talk is an easy to use and simple system that could be used successfully  by children and adults with emerging language skills. The instant feedback and the visual nature of the system will help in reducing communication frustration.”\nClaudine Ivers, Senior Speech and Language Therapist\n\nimage2talk is a simple to use, effective and fully customizable app that enables communication for individuals with whom verbal speech is impaired.\n\nWhether an individual is having difficulty communicating due to autism, stroke or any other communication disorder, image2talk can give that individual the ability to express themselves through the use of images, text and speaker output.  \n\nSuitable for adults and children, straightforward and adaptable customization within image2talk allows for the creation a personal communication tool.\n\nUnique to image2talk is that it completely eliminates the effort of having to navigate through menu or category pages. image2talk is based on the professional experiences of Fiona Wilson, a teacher working with students on the autism spectrum also presenting with general learning disabilities. \n\n“My brother-in-law was an attorney. A massive stroke stole his words. Losing his words was devastating. Showing him how image2talk worked, including family pictures with names, he touched picture after picture - repeating the word or phrase perfectly. He was never able to remember how to say his wife's or his grandchildrens' names until he had this tool? I added a picture of a heart, typing \"I LOVE YOU\" for it, shortened the time and now he can say, \"I love you, Elaine\"!!!  Do you know what a GIFT that is? ”\nJudi Smolin, USA\n\n“My daughter is 20 yrs old, moderate/severe Autism and though she can not talk, she does understand what is said to her verbally. She loves the REAL pictures. What I love about the Image2talk App is that it is so EASY to use, easy to change or add pictures, and the voice output is so clearly understood!”\nMichele Skoog, Radcliff KY (USA)\n\n* Tap and make images talk\n- tap the image - e.g. tap an orange\n- the image shows - see an orange on the screen\n- speaker output emits response - 'I want an orange'\n\n*Combine standard imagery with your own images\nCreate your own rows by deleting or reordering standard imagery.  Add your own images via the Camera roll.  Import rows from the gallery or your Dropbox folder.  If required, start off small and build up number of rows and images over time\n\n* Effective time delay - No need to press a back button\nTap an image, image enlarges and after a set time delay the basic overview screen will reappear. If appropriate, the time delay can be increased to give users opportunities to develop speaker and reader skills.\n\n*Features from image2talk\n- Tap image – it enlarges and speaks\n- Simple overview screen eliminating the need to navigate through category and menu pages\n- Basic default rows like food, feelings, etc\t\t\n- Easily customize image2talk at source to meet individual needs\n- Select gender and accent of voice\n- Available in English, Dutch, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese and Korean\n- Full library available in Dutch and French\n- Any text entered can be generated as spoken text\n- Import images from Cameral roll\n- Save images from the internet, computer or regular camera and import from Dropbox\n- Set time delay for basic overview screen to reappear\n- Turn text labels on/off\n- Turn voice on/off\n- Set a PIN to settings to prevent unwanted changes\n\nFiona Wilson has been teaching students with special needs for over 8 years and prior this taught in mainstream primary schools in Scotland and Ireland.",

Use different functions\nIn addition to talk, there are a variety of other functions that are useful for work.\n \n[Board] You can post a message to your entire department or organization. You can also check the read status of your own postings to prevent omissions.\n[Calendar] You can check the free time of meeting participants and easily grasp the schedules of members.\n[Task] You can select the requestor and the person in charge, set the deadline, and easily create tasks from the content of the talk.\n[Form] You can easily create and distribute various types of surveys from your mobile device.\n[Contact] The address book is always linked to the organization structure, so you can see the members at a glance even when they change jobs or form a team.\n[Mail] You can use useful business functions such as read receipts and reminders, and more.

With LINE WORKS, can I automatically connect with the people I am already friends with on LINE? \nA. No, LINE WORKS will NOT be linked to your existing LINE user account or friend list. The \"Start with LINE Account\" and \"Login with LINE\" functions allow you to use your LINE account in place of your login ID and password. This is a convenient feature for people who are not confident enough to remember their ID and password. \n\nContact us at\nhttps://line-works.com/en/",

      "description": "Welcome to the Tango Networks Communicator, where the power of your corporate desk phone is made available on your mobile. The app works in conjunction with Tango Networks’ Hosted or on-premises Accelerator server software providing unique mobile voice and message features for businesses. Please contact your company’s IT administrator for account and connectivity information.\n\nThe Tango Networks Communicator offers: \n\nShort Code Dialing: Can't remember your colleague's complete desk phone number while out of the office. From your mobile, simply dial the short code as you would in the office from your desk phone.\n\nIdentity Management: Want to present  your enterprise number to your colleagues and external business clients and your mobile number to personal friends and family members while using the app? Set up server policy rules to determine just that.  Or if you like, on a call by call basis, make that selection, prior to making the call, through the touch of a button \n\nPolicy Rules: Choose which set of server side policy rules are active. Is your boss bothering you while on your day off? An ‘out of office, do not disturb’ policy can take care of that. \n\nCorporate Directory Lookup: Need to reach someone within your company but do not remember their number? Search your company’s corporate directory and place a call, or email them directly from the app.\n\nVoIP Calling: Out of minutes or traveling overseas? Utilize the app’s built in Voice over WiFi/3G/4G capability to place and receive calls on the data network, bypassing voice minutes of use.* \n\n\nWe’re always excited to hear from you! If you have any feedback, questions or concerns, please email us at: support@tango-networks.com\n\nNeed help? support@tango-networks.com\n\nLegal:\n*Operator data charges may apply.\n*This App is based on Linphone which is licensed under GNU GPL v3 (http://www.linphone.org)",

        "description": "Welcome to the Tango Networks Communicator, where the power of your corporate desk phone is made available on your mobile. The app works in conjunction with Tango Networks’ Hosted or on-premises Accelerator server software providing unique mobile voice and message features for businesses. Please contact your company’s IT administrator for account and connectivity information.\n\nThe Tango Networks Communicator offers: \n\nShort Code Dialing: Can't remember your colleague's complete desk phone number while out of the office. From your mobile, simply dial the short code as you would in the office from your desk phone.\n\nIdentity Management: Want to present  your enterprise number to your colleagues and external business clients and your mobile number to personal friends and family members while using the app? Set up server policy rules to determine just that.  Or if you like, on a call by call basis, make that selection, prior to making the call, through the touch of a button \n\nPolicy Rules: Choose which set of server side policy rules are active. Is your boss bothering you while on your day off? An ‘out of office, do not disturb’ policy can take care of that. \n\nCorporate Directory Lookup: Need to reach someone within your company but do not remember their number? Search your company’s corporate directory and place a call, or email them directly from the app.\n\nVoIP Calling: Out of minutes or traveling overseas? Utilize the app’s built in Voice over WiFi/3G/4G capability to place and receive calls on the data network, bypassing voice minutes of use.* \n\n\nWe’re always excited to hear from you! If you have any feedback, questions or concerns, please email us at: support@tango-networks.com\n\nNeed help? support@tango-networks.com\n\nLegal:\n*Operator data charges may apply.\n*This App is based on Linphone which is licensed under GNU GPL v3 (http://www.linphone.org)",

      "description": "The cheapest AAC app compared to others offering the same features. \nChatterboards was professionally developed, in collaboration with Speech Therapists and end users, with the aim of providing people in need with an AAC app that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars or require monthly subscriptions.\n\nChatterBoards is an easy to use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) aid for people of any age who have speech or language difficulties. This can include people with autism, aphasia, apraxia, stroke, downs syndrome, or any other disability that causes the individual to have difficulties in communicating or expressing their needs.\n\nContinually updated with new features and enhancements. All suggestions and/or requests are considered.\n\nFull feature list:\n\n- Create and use vocabulary boards, including multiple paged vocabularies, for forming sentences.\n- Board levels. Levels provide a way to progressively build up a user's vocabulary. A limited set of words can be displayed at each level, progressively building up the number of words shown until the full board is used. Words/Tiles do not move position between boards, allowing users to remember and learn a number of words at a time without them moving.\n- Create and use basic phrase boards which associate a basic full phrase/sentence to an individual button, providing quick responses or questions for basic communication needs.\n- Ability to create and switch between different profiles, each with their own set of boards and settings. Ideal for households with multiple users, or specialists with multiple clients.\n- All board dimensions supported up to and included 16x16 (rows x columns) per page.\n- Fully customisable buttons. Change their text, colour (border and background), image and audio playback\n- Change a buttons image from either your devices photo library, camera, or from over 4000 sample symbols.\n- Includes over 3500 symbols provided by Mulberry Symbols (https://mulberrysymbols.org/)\n- Includes over 500 symbols designed by Freepik and distributed by Flaticon.\n- Save images from the internet, or from your own symbol libraries, into your photo library for use.\n- Supports text-only and image-only buttons.\n- Fully customisable button audio. Use the Text to Speech synthesiser or record your own voice(s) using your devices microphone.\n- Keyboard input mode. Alternatively to using symbols, manually enter desired vocabulary with keyboard input.\n- Text to Speech supports all iOS packaged languages (over 50 languages/dialects). Includes multiple male and female voices for English.\n- Change rate, pitch and/or volume of Text to Speech synthesiser.\n- Set App wide voice/language, rate, pitch and volume default values for the Text to Speech synthesiser.\n- Fully customisable boards. Change dimensions anytime, add, delete and move buttons as desired.\n- Copy existing boards to create new permutations\n- Copy/paste individual tiles\n- Share boards with other users of ChatterBoards. Use Apple AirDrop, Mail, Message, or any other valid installed application on your device. \n- The ability to lock controls, e.g. editing. Like a parental control.\n- Supports both iPhone and iPad\n\nAlso a number of Arasaac Symbols are included as samples (approx. 20).\nThese pictograms used are property of Aragon Goberment and have been created by Sergio Palao to ARASAAC (http://arasaac.org) which distribute them under Creative Commons License (BY-NC-SA)",

        "description": "The cheapest AAC app compared to others offering the same features. \nChatterboards was professionally developed, in collaboration with Speech Therapists and end users, with the aim of providing people in need with an AAC app that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars or require monthly subscriptions.\n\nChatterBoards is an easy to use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) aid for people of any age who have speech or language difficulties. This can include people with autism, aphasia, apraxia, stroke, downs syndrome, or any other disability that causes the individual to have difficulties in communicating or expressing their needs.\n\nContinually updated with new features and enhancements. All suggestions and/or requests are considered.\n\nFull feature list:\n\n- Create and use vocabulary boards, including multiple paged vocabularies, for forming sentences.\n- Board levels. Levels provide a way to progressively build up a user's vocabulary. A limited set of words can be displayed at each level, progressively building up the number of words shown until the full board is used. Words/Tiles do not move position between boards, allowing users to remember and learn a number of words at a time without them moving.\n- Create and use basic phrase boards which associate a basic full phrase/sentence to an individual button, providing quick responses or questions for basic communication needs.\n- Ability to create and switch between different profiles, each with their own set of boards and settings. Ideal for households with multiple users, or specialists with multiple clients.\n- All board dimensions supported up to and included 16x16 (rows x columns) per page.\n- Fully customisable buttons. Change their text, colour (border and background), image and audio playback\n- Change a buttons image from either your devices photo library, camera, or from over 4000 sample symbols.\n- Includes over 3500 symbols provided by Mulberry Symbols (https://mulberrysymbols.org/)\n- Includes over 500 symbols designed by Freepik and distributed by Flaticon.\n- Save images from the internet, or from your own symbol libraries, into your photo library for use.\n- Supports text-only and image-only buttons.\n- Fully customisable button audio. Use the Text to Speech synthesiser or record your own voice(s) using your devices microphone.\n- Keyboard input mode. Alternatively to using symbols, manually enter desired vocabulary with keyboard input.\n- Text to Speech supports all iOS packaged languages (over 50 languages/dialects). Includes multiple male and female voices for English.\n- Change rate, pitch and/or volume of Text to Speech synthesiser.\n- Set App wide voice/language, rate, pitch and volume default values for the Text to Speech synthesiser.\n- Fully customisable boards. Change dimensions anytime, add, delete and move buttons as desired.\n- Copy existing boards to create new permutations\n- Copy/paste individual tiles\n- Share boards with other users of ChatterBoards. Use Apple AirDrop, Mail, Message, or any other valid installed application on your device. \n- The ability to lock controls, e.g. editing. Like a parental control.\n- Supports both iPhone and iPad\n\nAlso a number of Arasaac Symbols are included as samples (approx. 20).\nThese pictograms used are property of Aragon Goberment and have been created by Sergio Palao to ARASAAC (http://arasaac.org) which distribute them under Creative Commons License (BY-NC-SA)",

      "description": "Are you responsible for communicating sensitive issues with the general public?  Do you feel like you could use some support when communicating sensitive topics with stakeholders? If you would like to sharpen your risk communication skills or test your risk communication IQ, download the Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center (NMCPHC) Environmental Program’s interactive risk communication flash card app to your phone!  \n\nNMCPHC’s flash card phone app allows you to practice specific risk communication skills and test your understanding of risk communication concepts on the go.  Use your phone to “flip” each flash card to reveal the answer. The phone app includes two new game modes that test your memory and score your results. Use randomized quizzes or the weighted learning mode which automatically sends the questions you have missed to the front of the deck so you can continue to hone your risk-communication skills. The complete set of NMCPHC Risk Communication flash cards and more than 150 quiz questions are included on this useful app.",

      "description": "Signal Flags Communicator enables a unique form of communication using flag images.  It is both a training aid to those wanting to learn to recognize the flags of the International Code of Signals, and an app to support and ensure privacy of communications, immediately, for anyone, with or without knowledge of the flags.\n\nIn operation, Signal Flags Communicator instantly translates written or spoken (via Siri) text into corresponding flag images, constructs a graphic representation of the text, and a proprietary FlagMessage file.  Once the composition is complete,  the graphic (PDF) image can be sent via email or text, and is printable on any AirPrint capable printer.  The FlagMessage file, which is simultaneously created, is intended for peer-to-peer communications via AirDrop or email attachment.  Recipients of the FlagMessage file, as peers,  can use their own Signal Flags Communicator app to translate and interpret the message when received, and save it locally on their device.  Since neither the PDF nor the FlagMessage file contain any scannable text, the communication is resistant to any text scanning by 3rd parties.  When transmitted via AirDrop, communications are secure and directly from one device to another, with no 3rd party involvement.\n\nFeatures include:\n• composing, printing, and sending of flag images and message content via email, text and AirDrop \n• A “native” app; all data is self contained in a protected form on the device\n• can communicate securely peer-to-peer via AirDrop\n• email capability uses a text-free proprietary format that cannot be scanned for text by 3rd parties\n• text messaging support for transmission of flag image content via a text-free PDF file \n• AirPrint support for printing flag images on all capable printers, including roll printers\n• recipients without knowledge or access to the flags can read the messages via use of the app on their own device\n• includes all International Code, and USN/NATO flags and pennants\n• capability to setup a message book, searchable for message text or meaning",
