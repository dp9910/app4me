Play online with 4-15 players as you attempt to prep your spaceship for departure, but beware as one or more random players among the Crew are Impostors bent on killing everyone.\n\nMASTER YOUR SOCIAL DEDUCTION SKILLS.\nCrewmates win by completing all tasks or discovering and voting the Impostors off the ship. The Impostor can use sabotage to cause chaos, making for easier kills and better alibis. Optional roles create a whole new level of gameplay. Try out the Scientist, Engineer, Guardian Angel, or Shapeshifter to create chaos! Think you’re a master of deception? Only one way to find out!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR GAME.\nChoose how you want to play! Change the number of Impostors, roles, tasks, player visibility, and more. Play in style as you change your Crewmates’ color, visor, nameplate, outfit, and hat. More customization options are planned to be continually added in.\n\nPLAY WITH ANYONE.\nCross-platform play is supported. Play with friends (or enemies?) between PC, mobile, or console!\n\nIf you have any issues, visit us at: https://www.innersloth.com/faq/",

And if it DOES happen again, the app will clear any unnecessary notifications on the next Discord app launch.\n\nThe following issues have also been cleaned up: \n\n- Sharing multiple images to Discord via the Share Sheet should now preserve the order of images properly. \n\n- Fixed multi-image embeds only showing the last image, as if you only heard a joke’s punchline before the rest of it. \n\n- Resolved an issue where the Camera Flip button wouldn’t function properly... although it still doesn’t make your phone do a backflip. \n\nAs always, see what else we’ve been cookin’ (or, I guess, uncooked?) over at dis.gd/PatchNotes",

There are many ways to enjoy the courses, such as collecting the 3 different types of colored coins or by competing for the highest score against your friends. You can try courses 1-1 to 1-4 for free.\n\nAfter rescuing Princess Peach, a nine-course special world, World Star, will appear.\n\n■Remix 10\nSome of the shortest Super Mario Run courses you'll ever play!\nThis mode is Super Mario Run in bite-sized bursts! You'll play through 10 short courses one after the other, with the courses changing each time you play.

        "releaseNotes": "***【Nuclear Fission · Energy Convergence, Exploring Star Dome · Seeking Secret City】​***\n\n1. New Official Level: \"Atomic Energy\": Stepping into the \"Atomic Energy\" level, you immediately break into a hidden underground nuclear engineering secret realm deep in the mountains. The entire scene is based on silver-gray metal pipelines and thick concrete. Energy beams intertwined with orange-yellow and dark blue flow along the pipe walls. The quantum energy ring in the core area pulses and flickers in rhythm with the fusion process. The floating AR control panel displays beating reactor parameters. Combined with the low rumble of mechanical operation and the high-frequency hum of energy surging, it creates a hardcore and realistic nuclear energy technology space.​\n\n2. New Co-created Level: \"Celestial Vault\": Stepping into the \"Celestial Vault\" level, it feels like falling into an ancient city wrapped in a nebula. The entire scene is dominated by dark purple nebulae and silver-white stardust. The towering dome buildings are covered with glowing alien runes.

Here’s what’s new:\n\n- Fresh Beats (Beta): \nWe’re introducing a brand-new temporary perk that instantly boosts your crops, animals, or production for a short time. This early preview will be available for beta-testing to some players while we collect feedback and refine it. We’re looking forward to hearing the community's reaction to this feature before the full rollout.\n\n- Tiny Trail: \nWe are testing a bite-sized Truck Order Event running for just 4 days, with Diamonds & Coins as the main rewards. Since this is an early test, not everyone will see the event right away. We’ll be working on ways to bring it to more farmers, in the future. \n\n- Surprise Boxes:\n A more intentional way to get the Decorations. Every box you open increases your chances of getting the reward you're hoping for.\n\n- Seasonal Creatures: \nLimited-time visitors can appear on your farm, friends’ farms, or during special in-game events. Keep your eyes open, and you might see some guests appearing soon...\n\n- Easier Tree & Bush Help Requests: \nWe are making it easier to request help for bushes and trees. Drag the help sign across multiple fruit trees and bushes to request help all at once.\n\n- New Animals & Decorations, including Pet Birds: \nLet's welcome to the farm;  Blueberry Muffin, Blueberry Cheesecake, Brown Capybara Pup, Red Capybara Pup, Horse Stable, Scarlet Macaw,  Hyacinth Macaw (Available in October).\n\n- Derby Improvements: Multiple Derby bug fixes & improvements.",

      "description": "Read on for important info below!\n\nClaim the crown as king of the underground as you race for dominance in the first white-knuckle edition of Need for Speed made just for mobile – from the game developer that brought you Real Racing 3. \n\nBuild the ride that shows your style with an unbelievable range of cars and customizations. Launch yourself between chaos and control as you hit the pedal and roll into underground street racing. Takedown the competition, up your rep, then kick into more races, more customizations, and more cars. Make your choices and never look back.\n\nThis app offers in app purchases. You may disable in app purchases using your device settings.\n\nCUSTOMIZE EXTREME RIDES\nStock your garage with the real-world cars you’ve always wanted, from top manufacturers such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Pagani, Koenigsegg, Hennessey, and more. Then trick them out with the hottest customization system on mobile, from spots like the Mod Shop and the Black Market, giving you over 2.5 million custom combos to play with. Your rides are waiting – take them to the streets to go head-to-head with the competition and prove yourself. \n\nDRIVE FAST – AND FEARLESS \nSteer onto the streets of Blackridge, accelerate over jumps and around debris, into traffic, against walls, and through high-speed Nitro Zones. Flip on the nitrous and thrust yourself into another level of adrenaline-fueled driving and drifting. Around every corner is a fresh race as you clash with local crews and local cops. It’s a world full of wannabe drivers – can you stay in front and earn respect? \n\nRACE TO WIN\nNever back down as you race anyone crazy enough to take you on, leave them gapped, and increase your rep. Dig, drift, drag, and roll your ride to the finish line while outrunning the police on your tail. Burn rubber in over 1,000 challenging races – and that’s just the starting line. Be notorious, own the streets, and score the world’s best cars. Because one ride is never enough!\n\n---------------------\nUser Agreement: terms.ea.com\nVisit https://help.ea.com/ for assistance or inquiries. \n\nEA may retire online features and services after 30 days’ notice posted on www.ea.com/1/service-updates\n\nImportant Consumer Information: \nThis app: requires a persistent Internet connection (network fees may apply); Requires acceptance of EA’s Privacy & Cookie Policy and User Agreement. includes in-game advertising; collects data through third party analytics technology (see Privacy & Cookie Policy for details); contains direct links to the Internet and social networking sites intended for an audience over 13.\n\nBy installing this game, you consent to its installation and the installation of any game updates or upgrades released through your platform.

It’s a world full of wannabe drivers – can you stay in front and earn respect? \n\nRACE TO WIN\nNever back down as you race anyone crazy enough to take you on, leave them gapped, and increase your rep.

We surveyed the community, weighed your calls to buff and nerf, and we're shipping our first big balance pass. Thanks for the feedback — some old favorites should find their way back into the meta.\n - New Season: Ash Crown. Blood-soaked courts rise, hunters follow, and one crown waits in the dark.\n - Ash Crown Armory. New tools for the hunt — whether you’re chasing vampires or stalking hunters: blood in the barrel, bats in the shadows, explosions underfoot, and lifesteal to keep you standing. Everything you need to make this night unforgettable.\n - Ash Crown Heroes. From both court and hunt: a lone knight who keeps the vow, a sovereign who dares the worthy, a bitten tracker who refused the turn, and an ancient hunger that drinks without shame.\n - Pixelpoly. You waited — and it’s back. Hit the board, roll for rewards. New rule: wins = dice. No wins? No dice. Grand prize: the legendary PBX-45.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n - Map Rotation\n - Bug Fixes",

You wish!\n\nYour ball smashes like a brick through colorful platforms that block its descent, but if you hit a black one, it's all over! Your ball shatters to pieces and you have to start your fall all over again.\n\nBut even black platforms are no match for a fireball falling at full speed! Choose your strategy: speed up like a madman or stop and wait for your next chance to roll and jump. Other ball games wish they were this fun!\n\nWhy Stack Ball rules:\n\n- Crazy fast speed\n- Fun gameplay\n- Bright vibrant graphics\n- Simple and easy to play\n- Great time killer",

This is a Sudoku like one you have never experienced before ;)\n\n...Thousands of puzzles, all free.  Top class puzzles with selectable level of difficulty :)\n________________________________\nTo the classic Sudoku, we added:\n\n=> A smart point system, wherein your score is based on 1) the value of each number multiplied (at the time of its match) by a multiplier that decreases in time and 2) the value of each block, row, column multiplied (at the time of its completion) by the decreasing multiplier\n\n=> Thanks to Game Center, you can now rank and compare Sudoku scores and achievements against friends and strangers\n\n=> ▻Sudoku also counts the runs, that is, each uninterrupted sequence of games won, and adds them to the online leaderboards \n________________________________\nIn ▻Sudoku, you win a game when you solve a puzzle with 3 errors or less (we used this threshold to give a bit of slack for mis-tapping :) Also, you have a number of hints to help you play (more at the easy, less at the hard level). To fit any taste, you can choose between a lush tile look or a more classic board look :) \n________________________________\nWhat our testers are saying:\n\n• \"The game is perfect! I am really loving ▻Sudoku. It is very addicting and fun, absolutely the best sudoku I have ever played.\"\n• \"Fabulous!

Top class puzzles with selectable level of difficulty :)\n________________________________\nTo the classic Sudoku, we added:\n\n=> A smart point system, wherein your score is based on 1) the value of each number multiplied (at the time of its match) by a multiplier that decreases in time and 2) the value of each block, row, column multiplied (at the time of its completion) by the decreasing multiplier\n\n=> Thanks to Game Center, you can now rank and compare Sudoku scores and achievements against friends and strangers\n\n=> ▻Sudoku also counts the runs, that is, each uninterrupted sequence of games won, and adds them to the online leaderboards \n________________________________\nIn ▻Sudoku, you win a game when you solve a puzzle with 3 errors or less (we used this threshold to give a bit of slack for mis-tapping :) Also, you have a number of hints to help you play (more at the easy, less at the hard level). To fit any taste, you can choose between a lush tile look or a more classic board look :) \n________________________________\nWhat our testers are saying:\n\n• \"The game is perfect!

It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!\nWhether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.\nPaper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.",

        "description": "Discover Voodoo's new game: Paper.io.\nYour goal? To conquer as much territory as possible. It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!\nWhether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.\nPaper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.",
