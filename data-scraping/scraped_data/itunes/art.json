      "description": "As seen on Shark Tank and featured in Apple's Apps We Love, Watercolor Artist Magazine, Handmade Seller Magazine, LifeHacker, MakeUseOf, Fast Company (Innovation Award winner), Apple News and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by millions of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.\n\nTerms of Use Link: http://davincieyeapp.com/terms-of-service/",

        "description": "As seen on Shark Tank and featured in Apple's Apps We Love, Watercolor Artist Magazine, Handmade Seller Magazine, LifeHacker, MakeUseOf, Fast Company (Innovation Award winner), Apple News and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by millions of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.\n\nTerms of Use Link: http://davincieyeapp.com/terms-of-service/",

      "description": "ARTDEX App is a convenient art digitizing “tool” to help organizing your art collection. \nAt home for those paintings on your wall or on-the-go to art fairs and museum visits. \n\nYour digitized artwork on ARTDEX App will not get mixed with hundreds of your holiday and family photos! Artwork photo images taken from your ARTDEX App get deposited directly to your ARTDEX folder.\n\nYou can then efficiently organize them by a quick “touch and drop” to each collection folder, and maintain your personal archive - i.e. Frieze Art Fair 2015, Orchard Gallery Show, Pratt Student Exhibit 2015, Shanghai Contemporary Museum, etc. etc.\n\nARTDEX offers web and mobile based art collection archive & management tool and professional social network combined platform, providing an easy-to-use and social forum, to create and share digital art inventories of both physical & virtual art collections. \n\nARTDEX.COM platform connects a global community of artists, collectors, curators, and all levels of art professionals and art enthusiasts, beyond geographical barriers and existing commercial art sales channels, to share undiscovered art, valuable art information, and inspirations with one another.\n\n\nFeatures: \n\n*Account: First sign up on ARTDEX.COM and create your profile. \n\n*Add Art: Use ARTDEX App to “snap” a photo of any art piece, to organize your physical art collections, at home and on the go (art fairs, gallery visits, museum exhibitions and more!) \n\n*Organize: Create a new folder “+” to organize your art images as easy as “touch and drop”.\n\n*My Connections: View and manage who you’re currently  following and who your followers are. Invite your friends and contacts to join your art circle and share artwork and inspirations.",

Artwork photo images taken from your ARTDEX App get deposited directly to your ARTDEX folder.\n\nYou can then efficiently organize them by a quick “touch and drop” to each collection folder, and maintain your personal archive - i.e. Frieze Art Fair 2015, Orchard Gallery Show, Pratt Student Exhibit 2015, Shanghai Contemporary Museum, etc. etc.\n\nARTDEX offers web and mobile based art collection archive & management tool and professional social network combined platform, providing an easy-to-use and social forum, to create and share digital art inventories of both physical & virtual art collections. \n\nARTDEX.COM platform connects a global community of artists, collectors, curators, and all levels of art professionals and art enthusiasts, beyond geographical barriers and existing commercial art sales channels, to share undiscovered art, valuable art information, and inspirations with one another.\n\n\nFeatures: \n\n*Account: First sign up on ARTDEX.COM and create your profile. \n\n*Add Art: Use ARTDEX App to “snap” a photo of any art piece, to organize your physical art collections, at home and on the go (art fairs, gallery visits, museum exhibitions and more!) \n\n*Organize: Create a new folder “+” to organize your art images as easy as “touch and drop”.\n\n*My Connections: View and manage who you’re currently  following and who your followers are. Invite your friends and contacts to join your art circle and share artwork and inspirations.",
