      "description": "Flora is a new way to stay off your phone, clear to-do lists, and build positive, life-changing habits. Whenever you want to make progress towards your goals, plant a seed in Flora. As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it.\n\nHABIT TRACKER\n\nEnjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills.\n\nREAL TREES, REAL IMPACT\n\nWhy not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org and Eden Reforestation Projects, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.\n\nSounds good? Download Flora and join our 2,000,000+ productive users now!",

      "description": "## Top productivity app in 136 countries. More than 2 million satisfied paying users. Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 1,500,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused, Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked. (iOS 16 or above)\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 90 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never too late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is compatible with iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and can be used across these iOS devices with a one-time purchase. The full app with the aforementioned features is available on iPhone and iPad; on Apple Watch you can view live planting session and today’s focus stats. To download or unlock a non-iOS version, it requires a separate purchase. By logging into the same account, your data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to iOS limitations, the Allow List feature is only available on iOS/iPadOS 16 or above. If you’re using a device running iOS/iPadOS 15 or below, your tree will wither when you leave Forest during a planting session.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

        "description": "## Top productivity app in 136 countries. More than 2 million satisfied paying users. Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 1,500,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused, Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked. (iOS 16 or above)\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 90 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never too late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is compatible with iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and can be used across these iOS devices with a one-time purchase. The full app with the aforementioned features is available on iPhone and iPad; on Apple Watch you can view live planting session and today’s focus stats. To download or unlock a non-iOS version, it requires a separate purchase. By logging into the same account, your data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to iOS limitations, the Allow List feature is only available on iOS/iPadOS 16 or above. If you’re using a device running iOS/iPadOS 15 or below, your tree will wither when you leave Forest during a planting session.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

A rating and detailed information help you understand the analysis of each product.\n\nWhen a product has a negative impact on your health, Yuka also recommends similar but healthier alternative products.\n\n◆ A 100% INDEPENDENT PROJECT ◆\n\nYuka is a 100% independent project : product reviews and recommendations of healthier alternatives are done in an objective way. No brand or manufacturer can influence them in one way or another. Furthermore, there is no in-app advertising. You can access detailed information on our business model on our website (www.yuka.io).\n\n◆ 5 MILLION REFERENCED PRODUCTS ◆\n\nYuka established a database that contains 3 million food products and 2 million cosmetic products.\n\nEach food product is evaluated according to 3 objective criteria: nutritional quality, presence of additives and organic aspect of the product.\n\nThe method to analyse cosmetic products is based on the analysis of all the ingredients of the product.

The one who spots a mistake and quietly fixes it. The person who makes it look easy (even when it’s not).\n\nTo support that kind of everyday heroism, we’re making it even easier to unblock your team on the go. You can now approve access requests not just for Projects and Portfolios, but also for Goals, Workloads, Dashboards, Capacity plans, and Bundles. \n\nAnd for the curious minds among you—AI Studio is ready to open up. AI Studio activities on tasks now include reasoning, so you’ll understand not just what happened, but why. \n\nAs always, we’ve cleaned up a few bugs and polished things behind the scenes. Quietly powerful—just like you.",

      "description": "In contrast to Screen Time, one sec delays access to apps and websites instead of blocking them completely – this is fundamentally different than any other screen time tool you’ve tried before!\n\nHave you tried a digital detox? And it did not work, because you fall back into your habits immediately? \n\nWell here is the solution:\n\none sec solves our unhealthy phone relationship at its roots: by making distracting apps less appealing, our brains lose interest to open them all the time without proper intention.\n\nThe effectiveness of one sec has been confirmed in a peer-reviewed scientific study with the Max-Planck Institute and Heidelberg University: app usage drops by 57% on average! Long-term!\n\nFight the social media algorithms and win back control over your phone usage & your subconsciousness!\n\n“one sec” uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a deep breath animation whenever you open one of the configured apps (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube…). This breaks unconcious social media habits short-term (literally, as soon as you have set it up) and even helps long-term by adding more friction when opening these apps.\n\nDid you really want to open Instagram? Or was it just because you're bored waiting for your bus?\nThis app helps you to reflect your actions, thoughts, and feelings; disrupting harmful social media habits with mindfulness.\n\nOn top of that, “one sec” also contributes your mindful moments to the Health App via HealthKit.\n\nEspecially for people with ADHD one sec is a great tool to gain back control for incredible focus and concentration.\n\nIntegrations and collabs:\n- You can set up one sec to sync tasks with Structured, so you won't be able to access social media apps during ongoing unfinished tasks.\n- You can set up one sec to learn a new language with LENGO, so every time you open social media, you have to answer a handful of vocabularies.\n\nAvailable Subscription Options:\none sec pro (annual / monthly / lifetime unlock)\n\nTerms (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://one-sec.app/privacy/",

        "description": "In contrast to Screen Time, one sec delays access to apps and websites instead of blocking them completely – this is fundamentally different than any other screen time tool you’ve tried before!\n\nHave you tried a digital detox? And it did not work, because you fall back into your habits immediately? \n\nWell here is the solution:\n\none sec solves our unhealthy phone relationship at its roots: by making distracting apps less appealing, our brains lose interest to open them all the time without proper intention.\n\nThe effectiveness of one sec has been confirmed in a peer-reviewed scientific study with the Max-Planck Institute and Heidelberg University: app usage drops by 57% on average! Long-term!\n\nFight the social media algorithms and win back control over your phone usage & your subconsciousness!\n\n“one sec” uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a deep breath animation whenever you open one of the configured apps (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube…). This breaks unconcious social media habits short-term (literally, as soon as you have set it up) and even helps long-term by adding more friction when opening these apps.\n\nDid you really want to open Instagram? Or was it just because you're bored waiting for your bus?\nThis app helps you to reflect your actions, thoughts, and feelings; disrupting harmful social media habits with mindfulness.\n\nOn top of that, “one sec” also contributes your mindful moments to the Health App via HealthKit.\n\nEspecially for people with ADHD one sec is a great tool to gain back control for incredible focus and concentration.\n\nIntegrations and collabs:\n- You can set up one sec to sync tasks with Structured, so you won't be able to access social media apps during ongoing unfinished tasks.\n- You can set up one sec to learn a new language with LENGO, so every time you open social media, you have to answer a handful of vocabularies.\n\nAvailable Subscription Options:\none sec pro (annual / monthly / lifetime unlock)\n\nTerms (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://one-sec.app/privacy/",

The app includes tracking of projects so you know how much time you spent working on each of your clients/books/websites/whatever - like a time sheet, but it's not meant to be an organizer or a to-do list.\n\n- This app will not let you pause work sessions or finish them early, so if you have a tiny baby-sized bladder and you need to pause every few minutes, this is not the app for you. The shortest work session you can set is 10 minutes and you're not supposed to be interrupted. Besides, I use this app too, and I'd be the first to abuse that pause feature to go look up useless nonsense instead of getting work done.\n\n- The purpose of this app is not to promote a healthy work-life balance, but to get you to work harder. Because of this, it does not recognize weekends or holidays or parenting or any other excuse people come up with to take time off, and it will demote you if you start slipping. Please don't expect the app to validate your personal goals, its sole purpose is to make you work harder, even when you shouldn't.\n\nThat's it, thanks for reading and I hope you find this app as useful as I do.",

        "description": "Get Power Apps to conveniently access your work or school apps no matter where you are: at home, on the road, in the field, off-campus, at the airport, or at the beach – anywhere life takes you.\n\nWHAT’S INSIDE\n\nThe Power Apps app is the front door to the apps at your work or school. Which apps can you use? It depends on what’s been created for you. Here are some examples you might see, or ones you can make yourself using the Power Apps website:\n\n• Campus app: Map your campus with icons for landmarks and facility details.\n• Event registration app: Record attendees as they arrive using barcodes or QR codes.\n• Expenses app: Let employees submit their expenses and upload photos of receipts.\n• Health clinic app: Let patients check in to appointments with just a few taps.\n• NFC reader app: Scan NFC tags on ID cards, equipment, packages, etc.\n• Performance app: Visualize data and get insights with interactive dashboards.\n• Sales app: See opportunities and leads, review comments, and approve for your P&L.\n• Space planning app: Take 3D measurements and manipulate objects in mixed reality.\n• Timesheet app: Collect, consolidate, and analyze shift data from employees.\n\nThis is just a handful of examples; the possibilities are endless. Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\n\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429",

      "description": "DayNinja combines the best productivity methods in the world: Pomodoro technique ™ by Francesco Cirillo, GTD by David Allen, Deep work, timeboxing and more all in one FREE app.\n \nBacked by scientifically proven time management methods this free pomodoro focus timer app will help you to be more productive.  Some features include:\n \n- Day View: Integrates with your calendar.  See your focus tasks planned out between appointments.\n- New Day: DayNinja cleans up old tasks and resets your timers ready for you to re-prioritise focus goals each day.\n- KPI Performance streaks: Measure your focus each day and compare with daily performance charts.\n- Metrics: Learn how many hours you spend doing focused work, breaks and the time you will finish your workday based on your goals and appointments.\n- To-do: prioritise your days’ tasks by drag & drop.\n- Target block count & estimates: keep motivated with focus goals, set your personal daily targets.\n- Optimised user interface: Quick swipe actions to keep you in flow throughout your day.\n- Customise your block & break durations as you grow your ability to focus.\n- Tags let you see at a glance related tasks and projects in your todo list.\n- Satisfying sounds keep your day light and a smile on your face as you slash through tasks.\n- Flow state friendly: keep working when you get in the zone and your focus time is still tracked.\n- Focus time summary: receive a report of your total focus time each week.\n \n \nThe ideal productivity tool for founders, professional freelancers, designers and coders.\n \n---\nFrom the author:\n \n\"Do you know how many hours of your day are actually productive, focused time?\n \nWhether it be phone calls, emails, your smartphone or well-meaning colleagues tapping you on the shoulder for a “Do you have a minute?” kind of chat, our days are bombarded with interruptions.  Before we know it, the day is over and we are left feeling rather down and thinking \"Eek!? ...Is that all I got done today?\"\n \nNow let’s just assume that it is possible to work in a quiet place away from external interruptions. Our own minds are an even bigger source of distraction, with a new thought entering our minds every 3 minutes! Unless we have a system, a method, a process - whatever you want to call it, the outcome is likely to be the same day after day: stressful mess bouncing between other people’s agendas and not getting your most important work done. Sound familiar? \n \nThis app has been inspired by proven productivity techniques:\n \nPomodoro timer: The idea is to work in predetermined blocks of time. To do this, simply break a task up into 25-minute segments without stopping or getting distracted.\n \nGetting Things Done®: Begin with a to-do list for the day and classify tasks according to priority.\n \n---\nYou have allocated tasks, time, all under your own terms, you have achieved your goals, performed every task with a sense of quality and you finish every day satisfied. It sounds simple, and it is…  in concept, but don’t expect to master this technique right away. It takes weeks of practicing the method day in and day out. It takes discipline. I have strayed at times when overwhelmed, I have reached the end of the week and wondered, “Where did I achieve this week”. It is those weeks when I have failed to be disciplined and failed to use the app. I have let other people’s agendas overrun my own.\n \nResearchers have proven that self-control is one of the key determinants of success. When you exercise self-control and self-discipline through a good part of your day, it cannot help but spill over into other areas of your life... How you eat, sleep and your health and happiness. Stick with it, and you too will be a DayNinja. \n \nNathan Challen\ntheDayNinja.com\n \nWant to learn more? read: “Zen and the art of getting Sh*t done” & Medium or subscribe for more productivity tips.\n\nPsst!

        "description": "DayNinja combines the best productivity methods in the world: Pomodoro technique ™ by Francesco Cirillo, GTD by David Allen, Deep work, timeboxing and more all in one FREE app.\n \nBacked by scientifically proven time management methods this free pomodoro focus timer app will help you to be more productive.  Some features include:\n \n- Day View: Integrates with your calendar.  See your focus tasks planned out between appointments.\n- New Day: DayNinja cleans up old tasks and resets your timers ready for you to re-prioritise focus goals each day.\n- KPI Performance streaks: Measure your focus each day and compare with daily performance charts.\n- Metrics: Learn how many hours you spend doing focused work, breaks and the time you will finish your workday based on your goals and appointments.\n- To-do: prioritise your days’ tasks by drag & drop.\n- Target block count & estimates: keep motivated with focus goals, set your personal daily targets.\n- Optimised user interface: Quick swipe actions to keep you in flow throughout your day.\n- Customise your block & break durations as you grow your ability to focus.\n- Tags let you see at a glance related tasks and projects in your todo list.\n- Satisfying sounds keep your day light and a smile on your face as you slash through tasks.\n- Flow state friendly: keep working when you get in the zone and your focus time is still tracked.\n- Focus time summary: receive a report of your total focus time each week.\n \n \nThe ideal productivity tool for founders, professional freelancers, designers and coders.\n \n---\nFrom the author:\n \n\"Do you know how many hours of your day are actually productive, focused time?\n \nWhether it be phone calls, emails, your smartphone or well-meaning colleagues tapping you on the shoulder for a “Do you have a minute?” kind of chat, our days are bombarded with interruptions.  Before we know it, the day is over and we are left feeling rather down and thinking \"Eek!? ...Is that all I got done today?\"\n \nNow let’s just assume that it is possible to work in a quiet place away from external interruptions. Our own minds are an even bigger source of distraction, with a new thought entering our minds every 3 minutes! Unless we have a system, a method, a process - whatever you want to call it, the outcome is likely to be the same day after day: stressful mess bouncing between other people’s agendas and not getting your most important work done. Sound familiar? \n \nThis app has been inspired by proven productivity techniques:\n \nPomodoro timer: The idea is to work in predetermined blocks of time. To do this, simply break a task up into 25-minute segments without stopping or getting distracted.\n \nGetting Things Done®: Begin with a to-do list for the day and classify tasks according to priority.\n \n---\nYou have allocated tasks, time, all under your own terms, you have achieved your goals, performed every task with a sense of quality and you finish every day satisfied. It sounds simple, and it is…  in concept, but don’t expect to master this technique right away. It takes weeks of practicing the method day in and day out. It takes discipline. I have strayed at times when overwhelmed, I have reached the end of the week and wondered, “Where did I achieve this week”. It is those weeks when I have failed to be disciplined and failed to use the app. I have let other people’s agendas overrun my own.\n \nResearchers have proven that self-control is one of the key determinants of success. When you exercise self-control and self-discipline through a good part of your day, it cannot help but spill over into other areas of your life... How you eat, sleep and your health and happiness. Stick with it, and you too will be a DayNinja. \n \nNathan Challen\ntheDayNinja.com\n \nWant to learn more? read: “Zen and the art of getting Sh*t done” & Medium or subscribe for more productivity tips.\n\nPsst!

      "description": "I have an exam coming up. A paper due this weekend. And honestly... I don't feel like doing anything. \nDeadlines are looming, tasks are piling up, and I just can't focus on work or study. Sounds familiar?\n\nYou're not alone. We all go through these very human moments.\n\n But don’t worry! There’s a simple yet powerful technique designed to help you: the Pomodoro Technique.\nIt helps boost your concentration, manage your study and work time, and build momentum using a timer.\n\n How it works:\n1) Set a timer for how long you want to focus on studying or working.  \n2) Take a short break when the time ends.  \n3) Repeat. \n\nSounds too simple? Try it — you’ll be surprised how well it works!\n\n This app is built on the Pomodoro Technique, refined with user feedback to help you stay on track, stay focused, and get things done.\n\n Key Features:\n\n1 Customizable Pomodoro Timers  \n- For work: 10, 25, 60 minutes   \n- For breaks: 1, 5, 30 minutes   \n- Set your own durations for maximum flexibility\n\n2 Task Categorization and Time Management  \nTrack your study time and work sessions by:\n- Subject: English, Math, History, Physics...  \n- Work type: Emails, Meetings, Writing, etc.  \n- Study method: Reading, Listening, Memorizing, Note-taking  \n- Other: Programming, Drawing, Practicing, Test prep, Meditation \n\n3 Visual Progress Review   \nReflect on your focus patterns with helpful graphs:\n- \"Nice, I stayed on track today.\"\n- \"Hmm, hard to focus at home. I’ll try shorter sessions tomorrow.\"\n- \"Focus is off today. A quick timer might help.\"\n\n4 Focus Psychology   \nBite-sized tips and articles on:\n- Preventing smartphone distractions   \n- Breaking focus-killing habits  \n- The science of rest and how to use it wisely\n\n This app is for you if you're:\n- A student prepping for exams, quizzes, or assignments   \n- A professional boosting productivity at work   \n- A homemaker balancing house chores and personal time   \n- A language learner working toward certification \n\n It's a small and simple app — just a repeating timer — but it’s made for those who care about focus, productivity, and making each day meaningful.\n\nWe hope you’ll give it a try. It just might change the way you work and study!\n\n\nEULA (Legal Documents)\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "I have an exam coming up. A paper due this weekend. And honestly... I don't feel like doing anything. \nDeadlines are looming, tasks are piling up, and I just can't focus on work or study. Sounds familiar?\n\nYou're not alone. We all go through these very human moments.\n\n But don’t worry! There’s a simple yet powerful technique designed to help you: the Pomodoro Technique.\nIt helps boost your concentration, manage your study and work time, and build momentum using a timer.\n\n How it works:\n1) Set a timer for how long you want to focus on studying or working.  \n2) Take a short break when the time ends.  \n3) Repeat. \n\nSounds too simple? Try it — you’ll be surprised how well it works!\n\n This app is built on the Pomodoro Technique, refined with user feedback to help you stay on track, stay focused, and get things done.\n\n Key Features:\n\n1 Customizable Pomodoro Timers  \n- For work: 10, 25, 60 minutes   \n- For breaks: 1, 5, 30 minutes   \n- Set your own durations for maximum flexibility\n\n2 Task Categorization and Time Management  \nTrack your study time and work sessions by:\n- Subject: English, Math, History, Physics...  \n- Work type: Emails, Meetings, Writing, etc.  \n- Study method: Reading, Listening, Memorizing, Note-taking  \n- Other: Programming, Drawing, Practicing, Test prep, Meditation \n\n3 Visual Progress Review   \nReflect on your focus patterns with helpful graphs:\n- \"Nice, I stayed on track today.\"\n- \"Hmm, hard to focus at home. I’ll try shorter sessions tomorrow.\"\n- \"Focus is off today. A quick timer might help.\"\n\n4 Focus Psychology   \nBite-sized tips and articles on:\n- Preventing smartphone distractions   \n- Breaking focus-killing habits  \n- The science of rest and how to use it wisely\n\n This app is for you if you're:\n- A student prepping for exams, quizzes, or assignments   \n- A professional boosting productivity at work   \n- A homemaker balancing house chores and personal time   \n- A language learner working toward certification \n\n It's a small and simple app — just a repeating timer — but it’s made for those who care about focus, productivity, and making each day meaningful.\n\nWe hope you’ll give it a try. It just might change the way you work and study!\n\n\nEULA (Legal Documents)\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "Most to-do apps overwhelm you with endless lists. 3 Tasks keeps it simple: choose the three tasks that matter most and get them done. This method is backed by productivity experts as one of the most effective ways to focus.\n\nFeatures:\n• Write down your 3 daily priorities\n• Start and pause tasks anytime (Pomodoro-style)\n• Track time spent on each task\n• Clean, distraction-free interface\n• No clutter, no bloat—just one simple screen\n• Pleasant Tic-Tac sound to stay engaged\n• One-time purchase. No subscriptions.\n\nWhy it works:\nWhen you can only do three things per day, you start choosing what’s truly important. That focus leads to massive productivity gains without burnout.\n\nOur story:\nAfter trying every productivity app out there, we realized what we really needed didn’t exist: an app that forces focus on just 3 tasks a day. So we built it.\n\nPrivacy & Trust:\nWe never track you, never collect your data, and never run ads.\nTerms of Use: https://sagalab.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://sagalab.co/privacy.html",

        "description": "Most to-do apps overwhelm you with endless lists. 3 Tasks keeps it simple: choose the three tasks that matter most and get them done. This method is backed by productivity experts as one of the most effective ways to focus.\n\nFeatures:\n• Write down your 3 daily priorities\n• Start and pause tasks anytime (Pomodoro-style)\n• Track time spent on each task\n• Clean, distraction-free interface\n• No clutter, no bloat—just one simple screen\n• Pleasant Tic-Tac sound to stay engaged\n• One-time purchase. No subscriptions.\n\nWhy it works:\nWhen you can only do three things per day, you start choosing what’s truly important. That focus leads to massive productivity gains without burnout.\n\nOur story:\nAfter trying every productivity app out there, we realized what we really needed didn’t exist: an app that forces focus on just 3 tasks a day. So we built it.\n\nPrivacy & Trust:\nWe never track you, never collect your data, and never run ads.\nTerms of Use: https://sagalab.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://sagalab.co/privacy.html",

This is based on the technique followed by the legendary General and former president of the the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower. This method was made popular by Stephen Covey in his popular title “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People”.\n\nUsage:\nJust drag the ‘+’ icon to any quadrant to create a new tasks. Simple. You can move the existing tasks to other quadrants by dragging the task across. Once you are done with a task swipe right to mark it complete. If you want to delete a task just swipe left. Want to be notified on due dates? select the ‘bell’ icon and set a due date. When a task is due in the next 24 hours it shows a red marker on the task. If the marker is yellow it means that the card is due in the 48 hours. If the due date is beyond 48 hours the marker will be green in color. If you see a blue marker it means there is not due date for that task.\n\nHow to use tasks effectively\nEisenhower’s strategy for taking action and organizing your tasks is simple. Using the decision matrix below, you will separate your actions based on four possibilities.\n\n- Urgent and important (tasks you will do immediately).\n- Important, but not urgent (tasks you will schedule to do later).\n- Urgent, but not important (tasks you will delegate to someone else).\n- Neither urgent nor important (tasks that you will eliminate).\n\nThe great thing about tasks app is that it can be used for broad productivity plans (“What should i plan for the coming week?”) and for managing checklists related to certain tasks (ex: Grocery shopping list).",

      "description": "Welcome to Production Chain Tycoon, the idle simulation game that puts you in the role of a CEO managing your industrial empire. In this game, you must use strategy and careful management skills to optimize your supply chain, increase production efficiency, and become the ultimate tycoon. \n\nAt first, start producing essential resources such as wood and stone with a basic production line. You must expand and improve your operations and move on to more complex products such as concrete or plastic. You must carefully manage your resources and logistics to confirm that your assembly line runs smoothly and efficiently, even when idle. \n\nManage both supply and demand chains. Carefully balance production with demand to ensure that you are meeting the needs of your factories while also maximizing profits. Take your opportunities to optimize the assembly line to increase productivity and reduce upkeep. As the game progresses, the supply and demand chains become increasingly complex, but as an industrial tycoon, you are not afraid of such insignificant setbacks.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game is resource management. You must oversee the progress of your resource mining operations and make strategic decisions about allocating your resources to support your production efforts. This will involve managing logistics and inventory to ensure you have the materials you need to keep your factories running smoothly.\n\nKey features:\n- Manage an industrial empire\n- Optimize supply chain and increase production efficiency\n- Balance production with demand\n- Research and develop new technologies\n- Play offline, even without an internet connection\n\nIn short, Production Chain Tycoon is an awesome idle sim game with endless hours of strategic gameplay. It’s got a ton of focus on supply chain management, resource management, and technology development. If you are up to building your own industrial empire, give Production Chain Tycoon a shot!",

        "description": "Welcome to Production Chain Tycoon, the idle simulation game that puts you in the role of a CEO managing your industrial empire. In this game, you must use strategy and careful management skills to optimize your supply chain, increase production efficiency, and become the ultimate tycoon. \n\nAt first, start producing essential resources such as wood and stone with a basic production line. You must expand and improve your operations and move on to more complex products such as concrete or plastic. You must carefully manage your resources and logistics to confirm that your assembly line runs smoothly and efficiently, even when idle. \n\nManage both supply and demand chains. Carefully balance production with demand to ensure that you are meeting the needs of your factories while also maximizing profits. Take your opportunities to optimize the assembly line to increase productivity and reduce upkeep. As the game progresses, the supply and demand chains become increasingly complex, but as an industrial tycoon, you are not afraid of such insignificant setbacks.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game is resource management. You must oversee the progress of your resource mining operations and make strategic decisions about allocating your resources to support your production efforts. This will involve managing logistics and inventory to ensure you have the materials you need to keep your factories running smoothly.\n\nKey features:\n- Manage an industrial empire\n- Optimize supply chain and increase production efficiency\n- Balance production with demand\n- Research and develop new technologies\n- Play offline, even without an internet connection\n\nIn short, Production Chain Tycoon is an awesome idle sim game with endless hours of strategic gameplay. It’s got a ton of focus on supply chain management, resource management, and technology development. If you are up to building your own industrial empire, give Production Chain Tycoon a shot!",

      "description": "Do you want to have a better control over your time? Or maybe you want to free up a few hours for your hobby? Then Resultivity is a tool for you!\n\nResultivity saves your time by:\n- reducing distraction;\n- helping you to complete your tasks faster;\n\nOverall, Resultivity brings gamification into everyday work or study. Positive, game-like routine makes it easier to battle through mundane or difficult moments of work or study.\n\nResultivity works like a regular game where you score points and the difficulty level gradually increases. New levels unlock more productivity patterns or tricks. \n\nPoints system provides a convenient reference point throughout the day. Like in fitness, you can simply look at the number of steps per day - 10k or more – boom, it’s a great day, a small victory. In the same way, in Resultivity – if you score 1000 points per day – it is a productive day! Just a few of these days per week guarantees hitting your productivity goals for a whole week.\n\nMany people focus too much on the destination, when instead, they should be focusing on system of habits in place to get them there. \n \n“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit” (с) not Aristotle :) \n\nWe believe, that with the right habits, your goals practically take care of themselves.\n\nTherefore, Resultivity offers you a system of 5 steps:\n1. Answer the QUESTION - how productive you are right now?\n2. Take control of lost, “wasted” time\n3. Make one step at a time\n4. Track your priorities\n5. Crush your To-Do list\n(FREE integration with Microsoft To-Do, Google Tasks and Todoist)\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the Resultivity – a digital assistant, who never gets tired and is always ready to help you to live the day to the fullest.",

        "description": "Do you want to have a better control over your time? Or maybe you want to free up a few hours for your hobby? Then Resultivity is a tool for you!\n\nResultivity saves your time by:\n- reducing distraction;\n- helping you to complete your tasks faster;\n\nOverall, Resultivity brings gamification into everyday work or study. Positive, game-like routine makes it easier to battle through mundane or difficult moments of work or study.\n\nResultivity works like a regular game where you score points and the difficulty level gradually increases. New levels unlock more productivity patterns or tricks. \n\nPoints system provides a convenient reference point throughout the day. Like in fitness, you can simply look at the number of steps per day - 10k or more – boom, it’s a great day, a small victory. In the same way, in Resultivity – if you score 1000 points per day – it is a productive day! Just a few of these days per week guarantees hitting your productivity goals for a whole week.\n\nMany people focus too much on the destination, when instead, they should be focusing on system of habits in place to get them there. \n \n“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit” (с) not Aristotle :) \n\nWe believe, that with the right habits, your goals practically take care of themselves.\n\nTherefore, Resultivity offers you a system of 5 steps:\n1. Answer the QUESTION - how productive you are right now?\n2. Take control of lost, “wasted” time\n3. Make one step at a time\n4. Track your priorities\n5. Crush your To-Do list\n(FREE integration with Microsoft To-Do, Google Tasks and Todoist)\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the Resultivity – a digital assistant, who never gets tired and is always ready to help you to live the day to the fullest.",

      "description": "The B-hyve smart sprinkler timer app allows you to control or monitor your sprinklers from anywhere in the world with the convenience of your smart device. \n \nSmart Watering\nKnowing how long and how often to water your plants can be challenging.  When set to smart watering mode, B-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, B-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \n\nWeather\nWhen set in smart mode, B-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \n\nWeatherSense\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With B-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\n\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\nThe B-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \n\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.  This is also the companion app for homeowners with the Hydro-Rain B-hyve Pro Wifi Controller. \nPlease let us know if you have questions or problems.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

        "description": "The B-hyve smart sprinkler timer app allows you to control or monitor your sprinklers from anywhere in the world with the convenience of your smart device. \n \nSmart Watering\nKnowing how long and how often to water your plants can be challenging.  When set to smart watering mode, B-hyve takes the guesswork out of watering and utilizes Mother Nature, along with some really great technology, to determine the watering schedule for your yard.  When set and left in smart watering mode, B-hyve can save users as much as 50% more water over a traditional controller. \n\nWeather\nWhen set in smart mode, B-hyve uses local weather data to determine how much water is evaporated and transpired through your plants each day to know when it needs to water.  It also accounts for any rainfall that is in the forecast, shuts off the system for rain, then looks back to see how much actually fell.  That’s smart!  But all yards are not the same.  B-hyve also takes into account things like soil type, plant type, sun/shade and slope to determine a watering schedule that takes the water to the roots and helps avoid runoff. \n\nWeatherSense\nIf you want to be the one in control of the schedule, that’s okay too.  With B-hyve you can set custom programs to water how you want while still taking advantage of the local weather data to override watering in case of a weather event.  This will shut off your system during the rain and resume your program when the rain has passed.  That’s smart!\n\nIntegrated Irrigation Audit Tool\nThe B-hyve app also integrates the award-winning irrigation audit tool right to your smart device.  By performing a catch cup test on your sprinkler system, you will know exactly how much water is being applied rather than relying on estimated sprinkler head water use that other timers/apps use, which can be off by as much as 50%, saving you more water and money.   \n\nThis is the app for the best-selling, WaterSense and SWAT certified Orbit B-hyve Smart Wifi Sprinkler Timer.  This is also the companion app for homeowners with the Hydro-Rain B-hyve Pro Wifi Controller. \nPlease let us know if you have questions or problems.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

      "description": "DoneStack is an innovative journal that maximizes your productivity. Complementary to traditional to-do lists, DoneStack records what you have already done everyday. While to-do lists guide you on what to do, DoneStack boosts your motivation and momentum to actually do more. You will start to see each moment as an opportunity to add small but meaningful items to your done stack,  and these moments eventually add up to your most productive days. From your stack of done items, you can then visualize, measure, and improve your productivity on a daily and weekly basis. Best of all, you get all these benefits with minimal effort and overhead. DoneStack’s secret sauce is its design that lets you effortlessly record done items from scratch or from your tasks and habits. You’ll have to try it to experience its speed and efficiency.\n\nDoneStack is for you if you want to:\n\n• Be more productive each day\n• Establish and focus on your priorities\n• Understand and improve how you are spending your time\n\nHere is what we have in store for you.\n\nPrioritize your life: Establish your priorities through buckets. Each bucket captures an area of your life you want to focus on. They can be general areas like “Learning” or “Self-Improvement”, or specific pursuits like “Piano” or “Basketball”. Buckets ensure that you are not just productive, but also devoting time on the right things.\n\nTrack your day: DoneStack makes tracking items nearly effortless. Simply type in what you did, and optionally pick a bucket and size. The XS through XL size system leverages exponentially spaced intervals to quickly track time spent without sacrificing accuracy. You have to try it to see its efficiency.\n\nVisualize your productivity: Physically see your productivity as you stack completed items throughout the day. Items in your stack are color coded by bucket and sized by time spent. Your daily stack is not only informative; building your stack is extremely fun and motivating! Next time you are idle and well rested, you’ll definitely feel the urge to keep stacking!\n\nBuild motivation and momentum: Did we mention that building your stack was fun and motivating? One big benefit to using DoneStack is how you start your day. The app encourages you to simply get started, and adding the first item to your stack each day is especially rewarding. From there, each item you stack builds momentum for the next item, until you end up with a fulfilling day.\n\nPlan ahead: The built-in tasks and habits list also lets you plan ahead. Pre-record tasks you plan to do in the near future, so you can add them later to your stack of done items with one tap. Habits let you record items you will do repeatedly, so you can add them to your done stack anytime.\n\nImprove time management: DoneStack also has time tracking built in. See exactly how much time you are spending on each bucket on a daily and weekly basis. You can also set time spent goals, and analyze your time spent trends to identify areas of improvement.\n\nDoneStack is available to use for free. You can optionally upgrade to DoneStack Premium. While the free version of DoneStack allows you to customize 2 buckets, the premium subscription allows you to create an unlimited number of buckets. This will allow you to use DoneStack across all your priorities in life!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.donestack.app/privacy-policy/",

        "description": "DoneStack is an innovative journal that maximizes your productivity. Complementary to traditional to-do lists, DoneStack records what you have already done everyday. While to-do lists guide you on what to do, DoneStack boosts your motivation and momentum to actually do more. You will start to see each moment as an opportunity to add small but meaningful items to your done stack,  and these moments eventually add up to your most productive days. From your stack of done items, you can then visualize, measure, and improve your productivity on a daily and weekly basis. Best of all, you get all these benefits with minimal effort and overhead. DoneStack’s secret sauce is its design that lets you effortlessly record done items from scratch or from your tasks and habits. You’ll have to try it to experience its speed and efficiency.\n\nDoneStack is for you if you want to:\n\n• Be more productive each day\n• Establish and focus on your priorities\n• Understand and improve how you are spending your time\n\nHere is what we have in store for you.\n\nPrioritize your life: Establish your priorities through buckets. Each bucket captures an area of your life you want to focus on. They can be general areas like “Learning” or “Self-Improvement”, or specific pursuits like “Piano” or “Basketball”. Buckets ensure that you are not just productive, but also devoting time on the right things.\n\nTrack your day: DoneStack makes tracking items nearly effortless. Simply type in what you did, and optionally pick a bucket and size. The XS through XL size system leverages exponentially spaced intervals to quickly track time spent without sacrificing accuracy. You have to try it to see its efficiency.\n\nVisualize your productivity: Physically see your productivity as you stack completed items throughout the day. Items in your stack are color coded by bucket and sized by time spent. Your daily stack is not only informative; building your stack is extremely fun and motivating! Next time you are idle and well rested, you’ll definitely feel the urge to keep stacking!\n\nBuild motivation and momentum: Did we mention that building your stack was fun and motivating? One big benefit to using DoneStack is how you start your day. The app encourages you to simply get started, and adding the first item to your stack each day is especially rewarding. From there, each item you stack builds momentum for the next item, until you end up with a fulfilling day.\n\nPlan ahead: The built-in tasks and habits list also lets you plan ahead. Pre-record tasks you plan to do in the near future, so you can add them later to your stack of done items with one tap. Habits let you record items you will do repeatedly, so you can add them to your done stack anytime.\n\nImprove time management: DoneStack also has time tracking built in. See exactly how much time you are spending on each bucket on a daily and weekly basis. You can also set time spent goals, and analyze your time spent trends to identify areas of improvement.\n\nDoneStack is available to use for free. You can optionally upgrade to DoneStack Premium. While the free version of DoneStack allows you to customize 2 buckets, the premium subscription allows you to create an unlimited number of buckets. This will allow you to use DoneStack across all your priorities in life!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.donestack.app/privacy-policy/",
