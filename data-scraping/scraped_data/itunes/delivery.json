      "description": "When in doubt, go for takeout—Seamless has it all. Plus, fun fact: Seamless is powered by Grubhub! Order food delivery from thousands of restaurants, including local spots and national chains, and get groceries delivered too. Prefer pickup? No problem. Know the fees upfront and track orders from Seamless delivery partners in real time. The only surprise is just how easy takeout can be. \n\nORDER FROM THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS\nWith Seamless, you can order takeout from your favorite local restaurants and everyone’s favorite chains. There are so many good eats out there, but you obviously deserve the best. Seamless makes it easier to choose your next meal with restaurant ratings and reviews. French fries, pizza, burritos, burgers, sushi, donuts—it’s all here, whenever a craving strikes. \n\nGET GROCERIES DELIVERED TOO\nThink beyond your breakfast, lunch, and dinner orders. Seamless offers the ultimate convenience with grocery delivery, in addition to restaurant takeout. Order milk, bread, snacks, and frozen foods, as well as household essentials like paper towels and laundry detergent, from local convenience stores.  \n\nEXPECT TO SEE THE FEES UPFRONT\nSeamless gives it to you straight. See the delivery fee upfront, before you start crafting the perfect food order. Pay your way with credit cards, Seamless gift cards, or Venmo.\n\nSKIP DELIVERY FEES\nThe key is Grubhub+. Sign up for unlimited $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, and enjoy exclusive offers and rewards as a Grubhub+ member.* Try Grubhub+ free for 30 days, then level up for just $9.99/month. The truth is, food tastes even better when you spend less on delivery. See details below.\n\nTRACK DELIVERY IN REAL TIME\nSeamless puts your delivery on the map. Track eligible orders in real time, from the restaurant to your front door, and know the moment your bacon-egg-and-cheese arrives. Every delivery is a special delivery with Seamless. \n\nCOUNT ON THE SEAMLESS GUARANTEE\nGet your food delivered on time and at the lowest price. Guaranteed, or we’ll make it right. Terms apply. See details: seamless.com/help/contact-us/learn-about-guarantee\n\nYOU DO YOU AND SEAMLESS DELIVERS\nSeamless serves up a personalized app experience, so you can reorder that feast you’re still thinking about from two months ago. Order sauce on the side, go for extra pickles, lose the onions—Seamless gets you. Are you a regular? Get rewarded when you come back for more at the same restaurants. You can also plan ahead by pre-ordering food for pickup or delivery. \n\nORDER FROM NATIONAL RESTAURANTS\nSometimes you need a sure thing, and that’s why Seamless partners with national restaurants to offer the takeout food you know and love. Get delivery from Applebee’s, Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Denny’s, Dunkin’, Five Guys, IHOP, McDonald’s, KFC, Panda Express, Panera, Papa John’s, Popeyes, Shake Shack, Subway, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, White Castle, and more.\n\nGET SUPPORT WHEN YOU NEED IT\nBurning questions? Delivery crisis? Seamless customer support is here for you 24/7. \n\n*$0 delivery fees only apply to eligible delivery orders from Grubhub+ merchants that meet the subtotal minimum (before tax, tip, and fees) on the applicable menu page or otherwise indicated on the Grubhub platform. Additional fees may apply. 5% pickup credit applicable on eligible future pickup orders only and is calculated based on the qualifying order subtotal. Credit is not transferable, not redeemable for cash, expires 90 days after most recent credit is issued and is subject to restrictions. Grubhub+ is an automatically renewing membership service requiring recurring payments. After your free trial ends, your free trial will convert to a paid Grubhub+ membership and Grubhub will automatically charge you each month at the then-current rate (currently $9.99) plus tax until you cancel.

We’ll deliver beer, wine, liquor, mixers, ice and party supplies within the hour. So why use Saucey? Picture this:\nIt’s Tuesday at 5:59pm. You think about it, and you realize you went a whole workday without watching that Netflix show. You’d better get home soon. Going to the store takes too much time and you need your wine to meet you at home. Order now, get home... we’ll press play together without a second to spare.\nIt’s Friday. Time to go make some stories for Monday. However, you’ve also had a long week. You are ready to rage - as long as it doesn’t involve a loud club or $12 vodka sodas. You hit the group text, offer up your place for a night of What Do You Meme? and then have Saucey deliver the Tito’s, Club Soda, and enough limes for drinks tonight and Bloody Marys tomorrow. #NightSolved\nYou wake up on a Sunday morning ready for mimosas but not for that long line at the brunch place down the street, so you say “Hey Siri, it’s brunch time.” That’s right, max laziness reached.

      "description": "If you are looking for an app to track deliveries on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple Watch - Parcel is the best choice for you. \n\nWith this application you can promptly access tracking information for 300 delivery services, including UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL, TNT, LaserShip, Aramex, OnTrac, China Post, Amazon Logistics and many other carriers. Full list of supported carriers is available at: https://parcel.app\n\nWith our unique carrier recognition function, adding a new delivery is just a matter of seconds. Sometimes you won't even need to enter a tracking number, you can use a barcode scanner which is available right in the app. \n\nAmazon integration in Parcel allows you to get your packages added automatically from your Amazon account. Once an order is shipped, it will appear in Parcel. This is done in a secure and privacy-friendly way with your credentials never leaving the device.\n\nYou can also locate your delivery on the map or manage your deliveries using Web Access (web.parcelapp.net) - easy and simple. Parcel has a native macOS app available for free in the Mac App Store.\n\nParcel utilizes the power of iOS to provide you the best possible user experience. You can use its widgets to see your upcoming deliveries and the share extension to add a new delivery directly from any other app.\n\nPush notifications provided by Parcel are more convenient than from any other app. They are being sent only from 8am to 10 pm according to your timezone, so you will not be bothered at night (however, you can disable this option in the settings).\n\nSome features, such as push notifications and tracking more than 3 deliveries are limited to premium subscribers. Current price for the premium subscription is $4.99 per year, and may vary from country to country. Parcel's privacy policy, as well as subscription terms are available at https://parcel.app/privacy-with-terms.html.",

You can now preview and view its details instantly — particularly useful for Amazon deliveries due to account restrictions.\n\nPreviews in Spotlight\nSpotlight search has been enhanced. You can now use the Quick Look extension to preview delivery information directly within Spotlight.\n\nChanges to Widgets\nParcel widgets now use App Intents for configuration. You may need to readjust your widget settings and/or restart your device to complete the migration.\n\nImproved Device Management\nWhen managing linked devices in the app settings you can now revoke multiple devices at once.\n\nNew API for Adding Deliveries\nWe’ve introduced a new API that allows you to add deliveries directly to your account. Documentation is available at web.parcelapp.net.",

        "description": "If you are looking for an app to track deliveries on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple Watch - Parcel is the best choice for you. \n\nWith this application you can promptly access tracking information for 300 delivery services, including UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL, TNT, LaserShip, Aramex, OnTrac, China Post, Amazon Logistics and many other carriers. Full list of supported carriers is available at: https://parcel.app\n\nWith our unique carrier recognition function, adding a new delivery is just a matter of seconds. Sometimes you won't even need to enter a tracking number, you can use a barcode scanner which is available right in the app. \n\nAmazon integration in Parcel allows you to get your packages added automatically from your Amazon account. Once an order is shipped, it will appear in Parcel. This is done in a secure and privacy-friendly way with your credentials never leaving the device.\n\nYou can also locate your delivery on the map or manage your deliveries using Web Access (web.parcelapp.net) - easy and simple. Parcel has a native macOS app available for free in the Mac App Store.\n\nParcel utilizes the power of iOS to provide you the best possible user experience. You can use its widgets to see your upcoming deliveries and the share extension to add a new delivery directly from any other app.\n\nPush notifications provided by Parcel are more convenient than from any other app. They are being sent only from 8am to 10 pm according to your timezone, so you will not be bothered at night (however, you can disable this option in the settings).\n\nSome features, such as push notifications and tracking more than 3 deliveries are limited to premium subscribers. Current price for the premium subscription is $4.99 per year, and may vary from country to country. Parcel's privacy policy, as well as subscription terms are available at https://parcel.app/privacy-with-terms.html.",

      "description": "inDrive, formerly known as inDriver, is a revolutionary ride-share application that boasts a presence in over 888 cities across 48 countries. Best of all, it’s completely free to use!\n\nWe're a new kind of rideshare app. We started up from scratch in 2013, and since then we've grown like crazy all around the world.\nAnd now we're bringing our game-changing rides to the USA!\n\nIt’s an excellent taxi alternative for your trip. You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. \n\nMORE CONTROL\nSet the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you\n\nFAIR PRICES\nOur rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees\n\nSAFETY FIRST\nVetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team\n\nAs a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take.\n\nWhy Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app)\n\nLOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS\n\nWe keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch.\nWe think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. \n\nQUICK AND EASY\n\nRequesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started.\n\nOFFER YOUR PRICE\n\nWe understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. \n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\n\nWith inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps.\n\nSTAY SAFE\n\nBefore accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers.\n\nADD EXTRA OPTIONS\n\nBy using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request.\n\nJOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\n\nIf you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative.\n\nWhether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative. Install inDrive (inDriver) to ride & drive on your terms!",

You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. \n\nMORE CONTROL\nSet the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you\n\nFAIR PRICES\nOur rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees\n\nSAFETY FIRST\nVetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team\n\nAs a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take.\n\nWhy Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app)\n\nLOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS\n\nWe keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch.\nWe think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. \n\nQUICK AND EASY\n\nRequesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started.\n\nOFFER YOUR PRICE\n\nWe understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. \n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\n\nWith inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps.\n\nSTAY SAFE\n\nBefore accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers.\n\nADD EXTRA OPTIONS\n\nBy using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request.\n\nJOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\n\nIf you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative.\n\nWhether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative. Install inDrive (inDriver) to ride & drive on your terms!",

      "description": "Deliveries helps you keep track of all your packages, so you always know when they’re going to arrive. Whether it's the latest gadget you've preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can't wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don't miss the doorbell.\n\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.\n\nDeliveries is also available for Mac. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.\n\nHave any questions? Just visit junecloud.com/sync and click Help.\n\nTerms of Use: https://junecloud.com/legal/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://junecloud.com/legal/privacy.html",

Whether it's the latest gadget you've preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can't wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don't miss the doorbell.\n\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.\n\nDeliveries is also available for Mac. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.\n\nHave any questions? Just visit junecloud.com/sync and click Help.\n\nTerms of Use: https://junecloud.com/legal/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://junecloud.com/legal/privacy.html",
