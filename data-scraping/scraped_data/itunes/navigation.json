      "description": "Yandex Navigator is the perfect companion for drivers.\nIt helps you find your way around the city with fast, convenient directions that avoid traffic jams and road closures. If road conditions change, Yandex Navigator adjusts your route on the fly.\n\nNo surprises on the road\nGet detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. \nIt also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.\n\nGet multi-stop directions\nThere’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.\nPlan a route with 4-10 stops and tap \"Optimize.\" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.\n\nGet your bearings anywhere \nNo matter where you are, Yandex Navigator shows you how to get to where you need to go. Search for restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, gas stations, pharmacies, stadiums, law firms, or anything else, navigating there quickly and stress-free.\n\nNever get lost offline\nFind places and plan routes even without a connection once you’ve downloaded offline maps for your city or region.\n\nPay for parking \nLook for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.\n\nPay for fuel\nChoose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.\n\nSteer clear of poor road conditions\nTurn on \"Avoid bad and unpaved roads\" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.\n\nPlan your trips ahead of time\nAdjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.\nFor example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.\n\nGet directions tailored to your vehicle\nIf you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select \"Add truck\" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.\n\nMonitor traffic in real time\nYandex Navigator updates your route details when traffic conditions change. You can also add widgets to your phone’s home screen that show traffic levels for your favorite routes so you can keep track of them even without  opening the app.\n\nSee your route laid out in front of you \nYandex Navigator is available for CarPlay, making it easy to follow your route on the screen in front of you without getting distracted by your phone. To make that work, you'll need a Yandex Plus subscription.\n\nThe app works in Russia, Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan.\n\nTerms of Use: apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula\nPrivacy policy: yandex.com/legal/confidential",

        "description": "Yandex Navigator is the perfect companion for drivers.\nIt helps you find your way around the city with fast, convenient directions that avoid traffic jams and road closures. If road conditions change, Yandex Navigator adjusts your route on the fly.\n\nNo surprises on the road\nGet detailed directions as you drive and find out about road conditions ahead of time. The app warns you about traffic, speed limits, cameras, and road closures. \nIt also lets you know when there’s an upcoming turn or complex intersection. And since it does that using voice notifications, you can keep your eyes on the road.\n\nGet multi-stop directions\nThere’s no need to waste time planning the most efficient routes if you need to make multiple stops along the way. Let Yandex Navigator do the work for you.\nPlan a route with 4-10 stops and tap \"Optimize.\" Yandex Navigator will reorder them to make the route as quick and convenient as possible.\n\nGet your bearings anywhere \nNo matter where you are, Yandex Navigator shows you how to get to where you need to go. Search for restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, gas stations, pharmacies, stadiums, law firms, or anything else, navigating there quickly and stress-free.\n\nNever get lost offline\nFind places and plan routes even without a connection once you’ve downloaded offline maps for your city or region.\n\nPay for parking \nLook for convenient parking spots near your destination. And since you can pay for them right from Yandex Navigator, you don’t need other apps.\n\nPay for fuel\nChoose your fuel type, select how much you need, and pay for it without leaving the app. Just tap the fuel tank button, and you'll see all nearby gas stations along with their available payment options.\n\nSteer clear of poor road conditions\nTurn on \"Avoid bad and unpaved roads\" in the route parameters or app settings. Yandex Navigator will guide you along smooth, paved roads wherever possible.\n\nPlan your trips ahead of time\nAdjust departure date and time settings to see how long your route is in advance.\nFor example, you can plan how to get to the airport the evening before your flight by setting the departure date for the next day. Yandex Navigator shows how long it usually takes to drive that route at that time, taking into account the usual traffic conditions. You'll definitely get there on schedule.\n\nGet directions tailored to your vehicle\nIf you're driving a truck or other freight vehicle, select \"Add truck\" in the app settings and describe your vehicle's characteristics. Yandex Navigator will get directions that account for any weight, size, or emission limitations.\n\nMonitor traffic in real time\nYandex Navigator updates your route details when traffic conditions change. You can also add widgets to your phone’s home screen that show traffic levels for your favorite routes so you can keep track of them even without  opening the app.\n\nSee your route laid out in front of you \nYandex Navigator is available for CarPlay, making it easy to follow your route on the screen in front of you without getting distracted by your phone. To make that work, you'll need a Yandex Plus subscription.\n\nThe app works in Russia, Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan.\n\nTerms of Use: apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula\nPrivacy policy: yandex.com/legal/confidential",

      "description": "Ever have a stressful day navigating on the water? Wanted to know more about the conditions you are about to head into? Are you looking for exciting places to explore, the best place to refuel, or just trying to meet up with a friend?\n\nWavve Boating takes a new spin on traditional boating navigation by bringing detailed nautical charts, tide predictions, weather forecasts, and more in one easy-to-use tool. Join a fast-growing community of boaters building a network of marine knowledge that everyone can enjoy.\n\nWith Wavve Boating you get:\n\n- Simple and Seamless Marine GPS Navigation -\n\nPut away overcrowded and complex charts and apps. Wavve Boating's GPS focuses on important and relevant information so that navigating is as easy as staying in the blue and avoiding the red.\n\n\n- Custom Nautical Charts -\nView and change Wavve Boating's nautical charts based on your unique boating needs and preferences. Set your draft and Wavve Boating redraws the nautical charts to fit your boat. Nautical charts are available for the USA, Canada, Australia and the UK.\nYou can view a map of our coverage on our website.\n\n\n- Community Boating -\nJust like at the dock or on the water, we all help each other in Wavve Boating. Share expert knowledge of the local waterways by adding shared points of interest to the map. The community can vote on pins, making sure they are all valid and valuable. Not quite ready to share a great find? No problem, you can keep your points of interest private as well.\n\n\n- Tides -\nTrack changes in water height in tidal regions and along rivers and lakes with the tides function. View a body of water in North America, and the app will update to reflect the current water levels. View predicted water heights up to 18 hours in advance and track the next tidal variances.\n\n\n- Weather -\nCheck the weather, including a complete seven-day forecast, across all of North America. Easily view the temperature, wind speed, and wave height as you move around the map. The local daily forecasts are color-coded to show if it is dangerous to go boating, using guidelines from the Coast Guard's small vessel advisory.\n\n\n- Fleets of Friends -\nSee who is on the water and where they are by adding friends to your fleet. Share your locations with members of your fleet to make meeting up a breeze. Want to keep your best fishing hole a secret, even from your boating buds? Easily hide your location to boat under the radar.\n\n\n- So Long Chart Plotters -\nMarine navigation is more than concentrating on a cluttered chart plotter. Get your head out of the cabin and enjoy the journey. Stop buying marine charts piece by piece for your chart plotter. Wavve Boating has integrated all the marine charts into one map for your boating GPS needs.\n\nSubscription Pricing and Terms\nWavve Boating is free to download, and all customers are welcome to a free 14 day trial period. Should you choose to continue to use the Wavve Boating app after the free trial, we offer two auto-renewing subscription options, monthly ($11.99/month) or yearly ($59.99/year). \n\nWavve Boating needs you! We've built the platform, but it is boaters that will build our Wavver community. Share your knowledge, share your time, and save a prop or two in the process.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\nWant to learn more about Wavve Boating’s marine navigation aid? Still deciding if this is the right boat GPS app for you to replace your chart plotter? Looking for an alternative to Navionics, Embark, Garmin Active Captain or other?  Head to our website to learn more. \n\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nhttps://wavveboating.com/terms-of-service/\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttps://wavveboating.com/privacy-policy/",

        "description": "Ever have a stressful day navigating on the water? Wanted to know more about the conditions you are about to head into? Are you looking for exciting places to explore, the best place to refuel, or just trying to meet up with a friend?\n\nWavve Boating takes a new spin on traditional boating navigation by bringing detailed nautical charts, tide predictions, weather forecasts, and more in one easy-to-use tool. Join a fast-growing community of boaters building a network of marine knowledge that everyone can enjoy.\n\nWith Wavve Boating you get:\n\n- Simple and Seamless Marine GPS Navigation -\n\nPut away overcrowded and complex charts and apps. Wavve Boating's GPS focuses on important and relevant information so that navigating is as easy as staying in the blue and avoiding the red.\n\n\n- Custom Nautical Charts -\nView and change Wavve Boating's nautical charts based on your unique boating needs and preferences. Set your draft and Wavve Boating redraws the nautical charts to fit your boat. Nautical charts are available for the USA, Canada, Australia and the UK.\nYou can view a map of our coverage on our website.\n\n\n- Community Boating -\nJust like at the dock or on the water, we all help each other in Wavve Boating. Share expert knowledge of the local waterways by adding shared points of interest to the map. The community can vote on pins, making sure they are all valid and valuable. Not quite ready to share a great find? No problem, you can keep your points of interest private as well.\n\n\n- Tides -\nTrack changes in water height in tidal regions and along rivers and lakes with the tides function. View a body of water in North America, and the app will update to reflect the current water levels. View predicted water heights up to 18 hours in advance and track the next tidal variances.\n\n\n- Weather -\nCheck the weather, including a complete seven-day forecast, across all of North America. Easily view the temperature, wind speed, and wave height as you move around the map. The local daily forecasts are color-coded to show if it is dangerous to go boating, using guidelines from the Coast Guard's small vessel advisory.\n\n\n- Fleets of Friends -\nSee who is on the water and where they are by adding friends to your fleet. Share your locations with members of your fleet to make meeting up a breeze. Want to keep your best fishing hole a secret, even from your boating buds? Easily hide your location to boat under the radar.\n\n\n- So Long Chart Plotters -\nMarine navigation is more than concentrating on a cluttered chart plotter. Get your head out of the cabin and enjoy the journey. Stop buying marine charts piece by piece for your chart plotter. Wavve Boating has integrated all the marine charts into one map for your boating GPS needs.\n\nSubscription Pricing and Terms\nWavve Boating is free to download, and all customers are welcome to a free 14 day trial period. Should you choose to continue to use the Wavve Boating app after the free trial, we offer two auto-renewing subscription options, monthly ($11.99/month) or yearly ($59.99/year). \n\nWavve Boating needs you! We've built the platform, but it is boaters that will build our Wavver community. Share your knowledge, share your time, and save a prop or two in the process.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\nWant to learn more about Wavve Boating’s marine navigation aid? Still deciding if this is the right boat GPS app for you to replace your chart plotter? Looking for an alternative to Navionics, Embark, Garmin Active Captain or other?  Head to our website to learn more. \n\nTERMS OF SERVICE\nhttps://wavveboating.com/terms-of-service/\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nhttps://wavveboating.com/privacy-policy/",

Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.

        "description": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.

Though PRO CHARTS™ will function without a GPS as a chart reader, a GPS-enabled device is required for point-to-point navigation. Third-party Bluetooth GPS units are available to enable GPS for iOS devices such as WiFi-only iPads that do not include a GPS receiver.

      "description": "TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE - Plan, ride, track and share your adventures with the #1 rated motorbike navigation app. 200,000 public routes, 20 million hours ridden, 130 million miles logged. \n\nGET THERE YOUR WAY - We’ve built a world for motorcyclists, helping you find the best routes with the twistiest turns, for paved touring and unpaved adventures. It’s not the destination that counts. It’s the journey.\n\nFIND THE ROAD - Straight, curvy, paved, dirty - Scenic lets you control your route like no other app. And with thousands of public routes to choose from, there's always road to ride.\n\nTAKE CONTROL - Plan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy.\n\nUNLOCK EPIC RIDES - Scenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search', and see what comes up. \n\nGO EXPLORING - Yet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing.\n\nGET ORGANISED - Found a great route online? Have some lying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB, or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure.\n\nFIND FOCUS - On-screen instructions, turn-by-turn navigation, and customizable detour behavior mean you can focus on the road, not your phone. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves, or one of the supported handlebar controllers.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Customize your map, toggling between built-in layers like traffic flow, safety camera alerts, and 3D buildings, as well as a huge list of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle services, restaurants, hotels, and more!\n\nONE STEP AHEAD - Dirt road visualization, elevation profiles, speed camera warnings, and traffic visualized on the map keep you prepared for what’s around the corner.\n\nGO OFF GRID - No data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back.\n\n KNOW YOUR RIDE - Scenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed, and elevation - helping you relive every moment, track your progress, and challenge your friends.\n\nSHARE THE ADVENTURE - Leave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalized web page of your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media.  \n\nCHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Personalize your map, seamlessly switching between visual layers like traffic flow and street view. Choose your own color codes to quickly identify and distinguish routes and a wide range of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle service points, restaurants, hotels, and much more.\n\n\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n** Scenic has an optional yearly Premium Subscription with a free trial period, that gives you access to Premium Features (see scenic.app/premium for details). The subscription automatically renews after the free trial period, and then every year. The first payment will be charged to your App Store Account at the end of your trial period. It automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of each period. Subscriptions may be managed by you, and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings in the Apple App Store.\n\nScenic's privacy policy: https://scenic.app/privacy-policy\nScenic's terms of use: https://scenic.app/terms",

It’s not the destination that counts. It’s the journey.\n\nFIND THE ROAD - Straight, curvy, paved, dirty - Scenic lets you control your route like no other app. And with thousands of public routes to choose from, there's always road to ride.\n\nTAKE CONTROL - Plan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy.\n\nUNLOCK EPIC RIDES - Scenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search', and see what comes up. \n\nGO EXPLORING - Yet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing.\n\nGET ORGANISED - Found a great route online? Have some lying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB, or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure.\n\nFIND FOCUS - On-screen instructions, turn-by-turn navigation, and customizable detour behavior mean you can focus on the road, not your phone. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves, or one of the supported handlebar controllers.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Customize your map, toggling between built-in layers like traffic flow, safety camera alerts, and 3D buildings, as well as a huge list of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle services, restaurants, hotels, and more!\n\nONE STEP AHEAD - Dirt road visualization, elevation profiles, speed camera warnings, and traffic visualized on the map keep you prepared for what’s around the corner.\n\nGO OFF GRID - No data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back.\n\n KNOW YOUR RIDE - Scenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed, and elevation - helping you relive every moment, track your progress, and challenge your friends.\n\nSHARE THE ADVENTURE - Leave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalized web page of your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media.  \n\nCHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Personalize your map, seamlessly switching between visual layers like traffic flow and street view. Choose your own color codes to quickly identify and distinguish routes and a wide range of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle service points, restaurants, hotels, and much more.\n\n\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n** Scenic has an optional yearly Premium Subscription with a free trial period, that gives you access to Premium Features (see scenic.app/premium for details). The subscription automatically renews after the free trial period, and then every year. The first payment will be charged to your App Store Account at the end of your trial period. It automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of each period. Subscriptions may be managed by you, and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings in the Apple App Store.\n\nScenic's privacy policy: https://scenic.app/privacy-policy\nScenic's terms of use: https://scenic.app/terms",

Alternatively, you can also purchase digital nautical charts directly via the app with a convenient annual subscription that renews automatically.

To make all the information easily accessible, the app offers a search function.  You can explore the surroundings and search directly for place names as well as anchorages, harbours, ramps, waypoints, cranes, fuel stations or tide stations. The app also offers fast and flexible auto-routing, allowing you to navigate directly to your destination and edit a route manually.\n\nNavigation on board is even more fun together! You can share your tracks with friends or use the data outside the app and export it as a GPX file. You can easily share your favourite harbours and anchorages from the app via a link and coordinate your trip planning even better with everyone.\n\nThe AIS function in the NV Charts App allows you to keep an eye on AIS signals in real time. A WiFi AIS receiver can be connected to the NV Charts App for this purpose. The AIS Class A and B targets and aids to navigation (ATON), as well as MOB AIS SART transponder emergency transmitters, are displayed, and the traffic situation can be better assessed. \n\nThe NV Charts App can be installed and synchronized on multiple devices.\n\nNV Charts App - Features: \n+ Search function\n+ Autorouting (Europe + other regions following soon)\n+ Velocity Made Good (VMG)\n+ Community Layer / Points of Interest(POI)\n+ Free online boating charts preview for planning\n+ In App Purchases of digital offline charts\n+ Community Layer / Points of Interest(POI)\n+ Reads all NV Chart chart areas \n+ Easy download of the maps\n+ Always the latest data \n+ Seamless zoom and panning functions\n+ Tide Forecast\n+ Online weather\n+ AIS Wifi Support\n+ AIS Sart Beacon \n+ AIS CPA function \n+ Night mode\n+ Anchor alarm\n+ Position with GPS \n+ Intuitive route planning\n+ Course markings, markings, bearing ruler \n+ Port information \n+ Display of instruments\n+ Synchronizing devices\n+ Live Position Sharing\n+ Social sharing of routes, tracks, positions\n\nNote:\nContinued use of GPS in the background can significantly reduce battery life.",

      "description": "Explore, Plan and Navigate your boating trips in real time and outstanding high-resolution with the latest NOAA Marine charts covering the whole of the USA and US Great Lakes.\n\n- Includes all US Coastal, Inland and Great Lakes Digital Vector Charts\n- Buoys, lights etc. are tappable with bearing and distance\n- Free Apple Watch app\n- Seamless panning and zooming across charts\n- Unique live Augmented Reality camera view\n- Route Planning and tracking with Waypoints, ETA, XTE, etc.\n- Offline charts\n- Route export and import\n- Live AIS Ship targets (requires Boat Beacon)\n- ActiveCaptain Marinas, Anchorage, Hazards and reviews\n- US NOAA Raster charts available via IAP\n- Canadian charts via IAP\n- British Virgin Islands & Bermuda charts via IAP\n- External NMEA over Wifi\n\nSeaNav is a Universal app, which works on iPad, iPhone and iPod.\n\nSeaNav uses Digital Vector charts providing a wealth of benefits and advantages.  Buoys, Lights, Bridges, Depth Contours, Depth Soundings, Rocks, Anchorage areas, NOAA Weather Buoys etc. are all selectable and have real time distance, bearing and detail information. Turn off layers to de-clutter the display and only show what is important at the time. Tides, moon and sun times and weather are also all available at your fingertips.\n\nSeaNav’s unique AR view mode allows you to view buoys, lights, ships, waypoints and track overlaid on your iPhone or iPad live camera view. With \"AR LockOn\" you can select a target on the chart and then be guided to it in the AR camera view.\n\nSeaNav lets you measure distances and bearings and record waypoints on routes. When at sea, the app’s Sailing HUD shows your position, Course over ground (COG), Speed over ground (SOG), Vector Made Good (VMG), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), Distance and bearing to next Waypoint. Waypoint reached alerts, auto-routing to the next waypoint and collision alerts.\n\nSeaNav has free Apple Watch and Pebble Smartwatch apps available. \n\nLowrance, Simrad and B&G GoFree support included.\n\nYour purchase of SeaNav includes 12 months of free updates to the included US chart set. Further chart updates are then available via an in-app purchase. Charts for other regions including Canada may also be added to your product via optional in-app purchase.\n\nOur in-app purchases are 1 year subscriptions, which automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Pricing for our 1 year US Charts update subscription is US$9.99.\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the iTunes account holder and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to  Account Settings after purchase.\n No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nOur Privacy Policy may be accessed via http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nRequires iPhone or iPad. GPS only required for real time route navigation. Optional Real time AIS, Tides and Weather information require an active internet connection. \n\niPhone devices and iPads with a cellular modem already have a built-in GPS, even if they do not have an active service plan.\n\nIf you have a WiFi-only iPad or iPod you will need an external GPS receiver or GPS feed to enable navigation.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION \n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful. SeaNav should only be used for basic navigation reference and should not be solely relied upon to determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com\n\nThird Party Licenses and Notices\nNOTICE: US Marine Charts are derived from official NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts.",

With \"AR LockOn\" you can select a target on the chart and then be guided to it in the AR camera view.\n\nSeaNav lets you measure distances and bearings and record waypoints on routes. When at sea, the app’s Sailing HUD shows your position, Course over ground (COG), Speed over ground (SOG), Vector Made Good (VMG), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), Distance and bearing to next Waypoint.

      "description": "Celestial navigation has never been easier!  With ezAlmanacOne and a sextant you will be finding your fix like a pro in no time!\n\nezAlmanacOne is an evolution of the iPad version of ezAlmanac with the modern user interface used in the Windows 10 version of ezAlmanac.  All of the features of ezAlmanac plus new features including:\n\n- Universal app runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and the new MacBook with M1 processor.\n- Supports all device orientations.  All screens support zoom and pan.\n- Make bearing observations to perform compass checks.\n- Archive saved observations and restore observation data from an archive.\n- Includes quick start guide, usage examples, and other documentation to learn celestial navigation.\n- Print/Output Nautical Almanac pages, observation reports, and other app documentation.\n\nezAlmanacOne will help you perform celestial navigation exactly as it has been done for hundreds of years. It produces all Nautical Almanac (1960-2059) and Pub. 229 tables exactly as you are used to seeing them in the printed form.  All tables can be accessed directly for manual usage if you choose to do so.  Since they are produced by the software they support zooming and panning, and you can highlight in the tables to easily find the correct value to use.\n\nMost users, however, will prefer to let ezAlmanacOne do all of the work.  Simply enter the basic sight parameters, make and enter your observations, and ezAlmanacOne will do the rest.  It performs all of the steps to correct your observation, find GP of the object, do the sight reduction, and plot the LOP.  No steps are skipped and all details are shown.  Click where the LOPs cross in the plot and you have found your fix!\n\nBesides finding your fix, ezAlmanacOne is one of the best tools available to perform compass checks from a bearing observation of one of the navigational bodies. The compass check function supports checking up to 5 devices from a single bearing observation.  ezAlmanacOne will also create a report of your compass check that can be saved as a PDF file or printed for the ships records.\n\nCelestial navigation instructors love ezAlmanacOne because it does celestial navigation exactly as they teach it.  Values obtained from the Nautical Almanac and Pub. 229 are clearly identified with an icon of the book.  When you press the book icon you are taken to the page that has that value with the row, column and value highlighted.  Even when ezAlmanacOne is doing all the work, it can teach you how to do it manually using the books.\n\nFor manual celestial navigation you can generate and print Nautical Almanac pages to use as a backup on a passage.  You can even print the sight reduction forms and plotting sheets you will need.\n\nezAlmanacOne performs all astronomical calculations using the NOVAS 3.1 software from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and a JPL ephemeris that covers the years 1960 through 2059.  It also implements WMM-2020, the latest World Magnetic Model software available from NOAA, to compute magnetic declination.  Since all calculations are performed in the software, ezAlmanacOne is fully functional with no dependency on the internet.",

        "description": "Celestial navigation has never been easier!  With ezAlmanacOne and a sextant you will be finding your fix like a pro in no time!\n\nezAlmanacOne is an evolution of the iPad version of ezAlmanac with the modern user interface used in the Windows 10 version of ezAlmanac.  All of the features of ezAlmanac plus new features including:\n\n- Universal app runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and the new MacBook with M1 processor.\n- Supports all device orientations.  All screens support zoom and pan.\n- Make bearing observations to perform compass checks.\n- Archive saved observations and restore observation data from an archive.\n- Includes quick start guide, usage examples, and other documentation to learn celestial navigation.\n- Print/Output Nautical Almanac pages, observation reports, and other app documentation.\n\nezAlmanacOne will help you perform celestial navigation exactly as it has been done for hundreds of years. It produces all Nautical Almanac (1960-2059) and Pub. 229 tables exactly as you are used to seeing them in the printed form.  All tables can be accessed directly for manual usage if you choose to do so.  Since they are produced by the software they support zooming and panning, and you can highlight in the tables to easily find the correct value to use.\n\nMost users, however, will prefer to let ezAlmanacOne do all of the work.  Simply enter the basic sight parameters, make and enter your observations, and ezAlmanacOne will do the rest.  It performs all of the steps to correct your observation, find GP of the object, do the sight reduction, and plot the LOP.  No steps are skipped and all details are shown.  Click where the LOPs cross in the plot and you have found your fix!\n\nBesides finding your fix, ezAlmanacOne is one of the best tools available to perform compass checks from a bearing observation of one of the navigational bodies. The compass check function supports checking up to 5 devices from a single bearing observation.  ezAlmanacOne will also create a report of your compass check that can be saved as a PDF file or printed for the ships records.\n\nCelestial navigation instructors love ezAlmanacOne because it does celestial navigation exactly as they teach it.  Values obtained from the Nautical Almanac and Pub. 229 are clearly identified with an icon of the book.  When you press the book icon you are taken to the page that has that value with the row, column and value highlighted.  Even when ezAlmanacOne is doing all the work, it can teach you how to do it manually using the books.\n\nFor manual celestial navigation you can generate and print Nautical Almanac pages to use as a backup on a passage.  You can even print the sight reduction forms and plotting sheets you will need.\n\nezAlmanacOne performs all astronomical calculations using the NOVAS 3.1 software from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and a JPL ephemeris that covers the years 1960 through 2059.  It also implements WMM-2020, the latest World Magnetic Model software available from NOAA, to compute magnetic declination.  Since all calculations are performed in the software, ezAlmanacOne is fully functional with no dependency on the internet.",

The app shows you directions that avoid traffic, tracks bus schedules, and knows all those fast, easy walking routes that take you around obstacles.\n\nWith Yango Maps, you get a stress-free driving experience with real-time updates on the road and clear instructions on how to navigate complex intersections. You'll get warnings about traffic jams, road closures, and speed limits ahead of time so you'll definitely get there on schedule. The app will also direct you to parking and fuel stations near your destination so that nothing stands between you and the places you need to go. \n\nYou can get directions even without an internet connection — simply download an offline map for your city or region, and you'll never get lost offline. \nYango Maps is also available in CarPlay so you can see your route laid out in front of you as you drive. This currently works in the UAE and Azerbaijan, and we'll add support for more countries in upcoming updates.\n\nFeel free to contact us at app-maps@yango.com",

Now, the bio is visible right away, and the map appears directly in the \"About\" section.\n- Previously, navigating back to the map while browsing in the Routes tab required several actions. Now, you can go back to the main map view with just one click.\n- The controls, like selecting a sport and starting an activity, are more accessible and intuitive when navigating and recording. Plus, the most relevant stats are prioritized depending on your sport type.",

      "description": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation.",

        "description": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation.",

      "description": "Discover our flight planning & real-time navigation app for free for 28 days!\n- Everything you need to fly around the world\n- Plan your flight in a few minutes\n- Fly relaxed with up-to-date information\n\nAir Navigation Pro is a high-quality flight assistant app for pilots worldwide. Benefit from the following main features:\n\nMOVING MAP\nPlan and navigate using our interactive moving map. Choose between aeronautical charts, satellite or our vector map as a background. On top of that, the moving map displays waypoints, NOTAM, obstacles and airspaces from our comprehensive, always up-to-date worldwide aeronautical database. Tap on any waypoint directly on the map to easily create a route. Personalize the values shown on the navbar to have exactly the information you need: altitude, vertical speed, bearing, distance to the next waypoint, ETA calculations, etc. Choose the airport departure and arrival procedures for your route to have them also displayed on top of the moving map.\n\nENHANCED TRAFFIC AWARENESS\nGet visual and audio alerts in all languages for nearby conflicting traffic. Choose your preferred traffic icon between generic, aircraft or TCAS symbols. Your safety is important to us, which is why we partnered with SafeSky to ensure our users have live traffic data during their flight. Benefit from the native integration with SafeSky included in our new Smart Lite, Smart Classic and Smart Advanced subscriptions—a two-in-one package!\n\nADVANCED WEATHER LAYERS\nIn addition to the basic weather reports & forecast of winds, TAF and METAR for your flight, subscribers of the Smart Advanced plan can activate see-through weather layers on top of the moving map. Available layers include rain radar, wind, pressure, clouds and rain, visibility, gust and for Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Balkans, we also have GAFOR. Tap on any point on the map to see the weather information for that area. Review the weather forecast for up to three days ahead.\n\nNOTAM\nAfter creating your route, set the departure time in the future to have the moving map display the NOTAM active for that specific time. NOTAM on the map change color dynamically based on their status.\n\nSMARTCHART\nOur cutting-edge SmartChart is a highly detailed and intelligent vector-based map that adapts to your needs, providing you with adequate information at any zoom level. The SmartChart optimizes the display of shadows to easily distinguish between valleys and mountains, and the text remains perfectly aligned, guaranteeing optimal readability. Including the latest significant improvements with forests and detailed airport information.\n\nELEVATION PROFILE & SYNTHETIC VIEW\nEnable the profile view below the navbar for enhanced situational awareness of the elevation ahead of you or along your route. Choose the corridor width between 0 to 5 NM and overlay options: airspaces, NOTAM, obstacles, wind components, populated places, etc. Switch to the synthetic view for additional terrain information, plus an artificial horizon with altitude and vertical speed indicators. This function can also be used to pan around while preparing for your flight. Activate TAWS on the moving map as well as on the synthetic view.\n\nAERONAUTICAL CHARTS & APPROACH CHARTS\nWe offer the most extensive worldwide catalog of aeronautical charts, including the ICAO charts. Have the georeferenced approach charts displayed on top of the moving map or the 3D view. \n\nBRIEFING\nPrepare your flight with our briefing section by creating documents with NOTAM and weather charts & stations relevant to your planned route. Optimize time by creating an aircraft profile which will be used in the Briefing section to pre-fill for you the ATC Flight Plan and calculate the W&B.\n\nAND SO MUCH MORE!\n\nPlease note that WiFi-only devices do not include an internal GPS receptor, an external sensor is required.

On top of that, the moving map displays waypoints, NOTAM, obstacles and airspaces from our comprehensive, always up-to-date worldwide aeronautical database. Tap on any waypoint directly on the map to easily create a route. Personalize the values shown on the navbar to have exactly the information you need: altitude, vertical speed, bearing, distance to the next waypoint, ETA calculations, etc. Choose the airport departure and arrival procedures for your route to have them also displayed on top of the moving map.\n\nENHANCED TRAFFIC AWARENESS\nGet visual and audio alerts in all languages for nearby conflicting traffic. Choose your preferred traffic icon between generic, aircraft or TCAS symbols. Your safety is important to us, which is why we partnered with SafeSky to ensure our users have live traffic data during their flight. Benefit from the native integration with SafeSky included in our new Smart Lite, Smart Classic and Smart Advanced subscriptions—a two-in-one package!\n\nADVANCED WEATHER LAYERS\nIn addition to the basic weather reports & forecast of winds, TAF and METAR for your flight, subscribers of the Smart Advanced plan can activate see-through weather layers on top of the moving map. Available layers include rain radar, wind, pressure, clouds and rain, visibility, gust and for Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Balkans, we also have GAFOR. Tap on any point on the map to see the weather information for that area. Review the weather forecast for up to three days ahead.\n\nNOTAM\nAfter creating your route, set the departure time in the future to have the moving map display the NOTAM active for that specific time. NOTAM on the map change color dynamically based on their status.\n\nSMARTCHART\nOur cutting-edge SmartChart is a highly detailed and intelligent vector-based map that adapts to your needs, providing you with adequate information at any zoom level. The SmartChart optimizes the display of shadows to easily distinguish between valleys and mountains, and the text remains perfectly aligned, guaranteeing optimal readability. Including the latest significant improvements with forests and detailed airport information.\n\nELEVATION PROFILE & SYNTHETIC VIEW\nEnable the profile view below the navbar for enhanced situational awareness of the elevation ahead of you or along your route. Choose the corridor width between 0 to 5 NM and overlay options: airspaces, NOTAM, obstacles, wind components, populated places, etc. Switch to the synthetic view for additional terrain information, plus an artificial horizon with altitude and vertical speed indicators. This function can also be used to pan around while preparing for your flight. Activate TAWS on the moving map as well as on the synthetic view.\n\nAERONAUTICAL CHARTS & APPROACH CHARTS\nWe offer the most extensive worldwide catalog of aeronautical charts, including the ICAO charts. Have the georeferenced approach charts displayed on top of the moving map or the 3D view. \n\nBRIEFING\nPrepare your flight with our briefing section by creating documents with NOTAM and weather charts & stations relevant to your planned route. Optimize time by creating an aircraft profile which will be used in the Briefing section to pre-fill for you the ATC Flight Plan and calculate the W&B.\n\nAND SO MUCH MORE!\n\nPlease note that WiFi-only devices do not include an internal GPS receptor, an external sensor is required.

      "description": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!",

        "description": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!",

      "description": "*30 Days Free Trial on initial download!*  \n\nPlan. File. Fly. Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 50 series portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.  Features include:\n\n- Worldwide Jeppesen NavData\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Radar and Satellite imagery for Western Europe, U.S., Canada and Australia\n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Worldwide METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, NOTAMs and winds aloft\n- VFR Flight Plan Filing\n- IFR autorouting and Flight plan filing in Europe\n- Terrain and Obstacles with alerting\n- Synthetic Vision (SVX)\n- Smart Airspace\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR charts from DFS, IGN and NATS and IFR enroute charts from EuroControl\n- Optional Garmin FliteCharts® and SafeTaxi® diagrams available on a country-by-country basis\n\n*Note: Use of GPS running in the background may decrease battery life.* \n*Note: One subscription to Garmin Pilot may be used on three devices.*",

        "description": "*30 Days Free Trial on initial download!*  \n\nPlan. File. Fly. Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 50 series portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

      "description": "* What is Sea Drive?\n\nSea Drive is a marine and boating navigation application focused on charting, navigation, route building, track recording, tides, currents, and more! Our goal is to provide the best user experience for boaters on and off the water. \nSea Drive provides FREE US charts! We believe that everyone should have the tools on the water to feel safe and know how to find their way home (or pull up to a restaurant).\n\n\n* Who is it for?\n\nSea Drive is for all of you who love the water! If you spend time on sailboats, fishing boats, bowriders, wakeboard boats, kayaks, or canoes this app will quickly become your go to co-captain\n\n\n* What are the features? \n\n**Offline Use\nSea Drive is meant to be used on the water and in the real world, that means cell service won't always be available. Charting, tides, currents, routing, tracks, GPS, compass, and more are all available without internet! \n\n** Free Chart Data (US)\nCurrently only US charts are available (and will always remain free thanks to NOAA and your tax dollars). As Sea Drive improves we will be adding other chart regions for free or as low cost as possible.\n\n** Tides and Currents\nTap a tides or currents icons on the chart to view offline predictions (for years into the future) at over 3000 locations.\n\n** Build and Navigate Routes\nBuild routes with easy to add waypoints, drag waypoints, delete waypoints, and give waypoints custom names. Export and share your routes with other boaters. Activate a route to see bearing (magnetic or true) to waypoints, estimated time to waypoints, and ETA at destination among other metrics. \n\n** Record Tracks\nReview and playback previously recorded tracks.\n\n** Create and Share Markers\nAdd notes and measure distances to markers.\n\n** Basic Features\nLocation (GPS & Compass). Caliper tool. Display settings for custom chart options. Vessel details for hazard avoidance and route planning. Satellite and road map chart overlays.\n\n** POI\nWe've integrated with marinas.com so we can show points interest directly on the chart for features like marinas, boat ramps, anchorage areas, inlets, locks, harbors and more.\n\n** Weather\nView weather forecasts for up to five days in the future including marine related weather like wind, gusts, swells, and wave information.\n\n** Live Track Sharing\nCreate a live track share and send the link to friends.  When imported, followers will see your current location and previous track directly on the Sea Drive app or website.\n\n* We love feedback!\n\nSea Drive is built by boaters for boaters. This is just the start of our journey and we would like you all to be a part of it with us! Please provide any and all feedback!",

        "description": "* What is Sea Drive?\n\nSea Drive is a marine and boating navigation application focused on charting, navigation, route building, track recording, tides, currents, and more! Our goal is to provide the best user experience for boaters on and off the water. \nSea Drive provides FREE US charts! We believe that everyone should have the tools on the water to feel safe and know how to find their way home (or pull up to a restaurant).\n\n\n* Who is it for?\n\nSea Drive is for all of you who love the water! If you spend time on sailboats, fishing boats, bowriders, wakeboard boats, kayaks, or canoes this app will quickly become your go to co-captain\n\n\n* What are the features? \n\n**Offline Use\nSea Drive is meant to be used on the water and in the real world, that means cell service won't always be available. Charting, tides, currents, routing, tracks, GPS, compass, and more are all available without internet! \n\n** Free Chart Data (US)\nCurrently only US charts are available (and will always remain free thanks to NOAA and your tax dollars). As Sea Drive improves we will be adding other chart regions for free or as low cost as possible.\n\n** Tides and Currents\nTap a tides or currents icons on the chart to view offline predictions (for years into the future) at over 3000 locations.\n\n** Build and Navigate Routes\nBuild routes with easy to add waypoints, drag waypoints, delete waypoints, and give waypoints custom names. Export and share your routes with other boaters. Activate a route to see bearing (magnetic or true) to waypoints, estimated time to waypoints, and ETA at destination among other metrics. \n\n** Record Tracks\nReview and playback previously recorded tracks.\n\n** Create and Share Markers\nAdd notes and measure distances to markers.\n\n** Basic Features\nLocation (GPS & Compass). Caliper tool. Display settings for custom chart options. Vessel details for hazard avoidance and route planning. Satellite and road map chart overlays.\n\n** POI\nWe've integrated with marinas.com so we can show points interest directly on the chart for features like marinas, boat ramps, anchorage areas, inlets, locks, harbors and more.\n\n** Weather\nView weather forecasts for up to five days in the future including marine related weather like wind, gusts, swells, and wave information.\n\n** Live Track Sharing\nCreate a live track share and send the link to friends.  When imported, followers will see your current location and previous track directly on the Sea Drive app or website.\n\n* We love feedback!\n\nSea Drive is built by boaters for boaters. This is just the start of our journey and we would like you all to be a part of it with us! Please provide any and all feedback!",

      "description": "Join millions of travelers around the world and take the journeys that matter. Using half the storage space of many other navigation apps, iGO Navigation is an offline app that guides you on adventures around the world. \n\nIncluding only the features that help you the most, we do away with distractions – just you and the world around you, because we believe that travel should be experienced between the traveler and the world, not the traveler and their phone.\n\nThe iGO Navigation app is for those who believe in a purer form of discovery, but want a helpful guide to push them in the right direction, whether you’re traveling in your hometown, a new country, or across a continent. The award-winning, full-service app now has improved visualization, accelerated route calculation, reduced storage space requirements, and advanced offline features, making it the best copilot to help you experience the world around you. \n\nFind your inner explorer, and hit the road like a pro. No more getting lost, no more wasting time, no more clogging your phone, no more searching for WiFi, and no more distractions. iGO Navigation: for the journeys that matter.\n\n\n************************************\n\nWhat does iGO Navigation offer?\n-\tOver 100 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Italy, France, Australia, Russia, Turkey, and more\n-\tHalf the storage space compared to many other navigation apps, saving room for more important travel necessities, such as photos, videos, and music \n-\tFast and diverse route calculation options to find the best route possible\n-\tPOIs to help you find restaurants, bars, landmarks, malls, stores, and more\n-\t3D landmarks and 3D city maps for clarity and easy-to-process visualization\n-\tOffline reliability to keep you on track, be it in a crowded city or remote backcountry\n-\tPoint addressing to accurately pinpoint hard-to-find locations and to navigate in places that follow non-sequential numbering or don’t have address numbering at all\n-\tJunction view to prevent confusion when entering and exiting major roadways\n-\tAdvanced Text-To-Speech for hands-free and turn-by-turn directions \n\n\n\n************************************\n\nIMPORTANT TECHNICAL INFORMATION\nInstallation and setup\nPlease note that since iPod touch and iPad (WiFi only) do not have built-in GPS-receivers, an external GPS-receiver is required. Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7.",

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7.",

      "description": "GeoNet –  The new-generation offline GPS navigator, which enables you to select and use maps from various map vendors.\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM), the project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. GeoNet maps based on OSM data offer worldwide coverage and stable updates\n\nCityGuide maps, with traffic information and regular updates.\n\nOther high quality maps from national map producers.\n\nMaps have various prices, conditions of use and update frequency.\nYou select the maps you require from within the GeoNET application.\nEach map has a short description and a star rating, and a trial period is available.\n\nGeoNET is an OFFLINE navigation system, which does not require a permanent internet connection.\nSelected map data is downloaded to your device, so you do not need to be connected to the internet during use, thus significantly reducing costs.\n\nOther GeoNet advantages:\n\n- Smooth operation and rapid route calculation.\nFull support for built-in hardware acceleration on most devices.\nRapid map manipulation.\nInstant route calculation, using traffic information where available.\n\n- Daily maps updates (online proofing)\nNo need to wait until next major map update.\nChanges in road conditions on maps (e.g. closed roads, no traffic, one-way, turn restrictions, and more) are sent to the map daily and used during route calculation.\n\n- Patented method of route calculation uses traffic information.\nWhen calculating a route, GeoNet uses our patented algorithm 'Jams-2', which takes into account direction of movement and traffic speeds. If traffic data is not available, statistical data is used instead.\n\n- Dynamic Points of Interest (POI) provide warnings of current road events.\nGeoNET users are warned, by voice and visually, about various current events along the route (police, danger area, speedcams, traffic accidents, bad roads, traffic jams, etc.)\n\n- Speedcams and speed radars.\n GeoNet provides advance warning of known stationary and portable speedcams.\n\n- Suggestion of new alternative routes during the trip\n\n- Smart voice search\n\n\nCAUTION:\nWhile driving, your first priority must be to follow driving regulations; use GeoNET instructions only when it is safe and legal to do so.\n\n\n- Garmin GPX waypoints import (Route: Waypoints)\n- PLT tracks import and export  (Route: Tracks)\n\n- Ask questions and make comments at the GeoNET forum: http://forum.probki.net\n\n* Long use of GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",

        "description": "GeoNet –  The new-generation offline GPS navigator, which enables you to select and use maps from various map vendors.\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM), the project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. GeoNet maps based on OSM data offer worldwide coverage and stable updates\n\nCityGuide maps, with traffic information and regular updates.\n\nOther high quality maps from national map producers.\n\nMaps have various prices, conditions of use and update frequency.\nYou select the maps you require from within the GeoNET application.\nEach map has a short description and a star rating, and a trial period is available.\n\nGeoNET is an OFFLINE navigation system, which does not require a permanent internet connection.\nSelected map data is downloaded to your device, so you do not need to be connected to the internet during use, thus significantly reducing costs.\n\nOther GeoNet advantages:\n\n- Smooth operation and rapid route calculation.\nFull support for built-in hardware acceleration on most devices.\nRapid map manipulation.\nInstant route calculation, using traffic information where available.\n\n- Daily maps updates (online proofing)\nNo need to wait until next major map update.\nChanges in road conditions on maps (e.g. closed roads, no traffic, one-way, turn restrictions, and more) are sent to the map daily and used during route calculation.\n\n- Patented method of route calculation uses traffic information.\nWhen calculating a route, GeoNet uses our patented algorithm 'Jams-2', which takes into account direction of movement and traffic speeds. If traffic data is not available, statistical data is used instead.\n\n- Dynamic Points of Interest (POI) provide warnings of current road events.\nGeoNET users are warned, by voice and visually, about various current events along the route (police, danger area, speedcams, traffic accidents, bad roads, traffic jams, etc.)\n\n- Speedcams and speed radars.\n GeoNet provides advance warning of known stationary and portable speedcams.\n\n- Suggestion of new alternative routes during the trip\n\n- Smart voice search\n\n\nCAUTION:\nWhile driving, your first priority must be to follow driving regulations; use GeoNET instructions only when it is safe and legal to do so.\n\n\n- Garmin GPX waypoints import (Route: Waypoints)\n- PLT tracks import and export  (Route: Tracks)\n\n- Ask questions and make comments at the GeoNET forum: http://forum.probki.net\n\n* Long use of GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",

Great for plotting tomorrow’s fishing spots or hiking destinations. \n- Share your location or saved XY’s with friends on iMessage or social media.\n- Explore by searching for XY's with latitude and longitude. \n- Navigate back to an XY with transit, driving, walking, or off-road navigation for compass-like directions always pointing to your saved XY (premium upgrade required).",

Great for plotting tomorrow’s fishing spots or hiking destinations. \n- Share your location or saved XY’s with friends on iMessage or social media.\n- Explore by searching for XY's with latitude and longitude. \n- Navigate back to an XY with transit, driving, walking, or off-road navigation for compass-like directions always pointing to your saved XY (premium upgrade required).",

For more information, consult the product details.\nSome important details we need to let you know:\n• When installing the app, make sure your phone is connected to a stable Wi-Fi network.\n• Never let the navigation instructions interfere with your driving.\n• Some maps may need large amounts of available storage. Please check your phone storage management for details.\n• When using Karta GPS while driving, never hold the phone on your hands. Place it on a standard holder, with a clear sky view.\n• Allowing GPS to run in the background for extended periods can lead to a significant reduction in battery life.\n \nIf you have any questions, contact us at: support@kartatech.com\nFollow us!\nHelp Center: https://kartatech.zendesk.com/hc/categories/200913869-Karta-GPS\nFacebook:  fb.com/kartagps\nYoutube: youtube.com/Kartatechnologies",
