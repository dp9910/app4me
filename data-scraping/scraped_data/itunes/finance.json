Credit Builder savings account is a deposit product, insured up to $250,000. Credit Builder is serviced by Credit Karma Credit Builder. Members with a TransUnion credit score of 619 or below at time of application may be prompted to apply for Credit Builder.\n\n**From June 2024 to Nov 2024, members with a TU credit score of 619 or below who opened a plan and had it reported on their TU report saw an average score increase of 17 points in 3 days of activation. Late payments and other factors can negatively impact your score.\n\n***Banking services provided by MVB Bank, Inc., Member FDIC. Maximum balance and transfer limits apply.\n\n^ Borrowing Power is based on the highest offer amount available to you through Credit Karma where you have Outstanding Approval Odds. The offers themselves are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.\n\n† Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the card shown, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there's no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don't meet the lender's \"ability to pay standard\" after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.\n\nScreens simulated.

Credit Builder savings account is a deposit product, insured up to $250,000. Credit Builder is serviced by Credit Karma Credit Builder.

The offers themselves are not guaranteed and are subject to change without notice.\n\n† Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the card shown, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there's no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don't meet the lender's \"ability to pay standard\" after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.\n\nScreens simulated.

You don’t have to pay state and local taxes on the earned interest from Treasury Bills, so you can focus on growing your savings. Federal taxes on earned interest still apply.\n\nINVEST\nWe’ll give you access to Atomic Invest’s Automated Investing Account to put your investing on autopilot. Get direct indexing with no balance minimums — allowing you to reap more savings via tax loss harvesting.\n\nLEARN\nWe’ll help you connect what’s happening in the news, the markets, and the economy directly to your finances, so you always know what it means for you.\n\nSHOP\nWe’ll show you financial products, and provide access to the Nerds' ratings and reviews for each one.\n\nDisclosures:\n\nNerdWallet privacy policy: https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/privacy-policy\n\nNerdWallet terms:\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/p/terms-of-use\n\n*The boosted 4.40% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is offered on up to $250,000 in deposits for the first 6 months when you open a Cash Account offered by Atomic Brokerage LLC and deposit funds within 14 days.

NerdWallet receives compensation of 0% to 0.85% of assets under management annualized, payable monthly, for each referred client who opens an Atomic account and a percentage of free cash interest earned by clients, which creates a conflict of interest. \n\nBrokerage services for Atomic are provided by Atomic Brokerage LLC, a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC and an affiliate of Atomic, which creates a conflict of interest.

We’ll provide you with actionable financial insights about your credit score and cash flow, so you can make smart money moves.\n\nEARN 4.40% APY* ON YOUR CASH\nWhen you open a Cash Account offered by Atomic Brokerage, and deposit funds within 14 days, you can earn a boosted 4.40% APY on balances up to $250,000 for the first 6 months.\n\nBUILD\nWe’ve partnered with Atomic Invest to give you access to their Treasury Account to invest in U.S. Treasury Bills. You don’t have to pay state and local taxes on the earned interest from Treasury Bills, so you can focus on growing your savings. Federal taxes on earned interest still apply.\n\nINVEST\nWe’ll give you access to Atomic Invest’s Automated Investing Account to put your investing on autopilot. Get direct indexing with no balance minimums — allowing you to reap more savings via tax loss harvesting.\n\nLEARN\nWe’ll help you connect what’s happening in the news, the markets, and the economy directly to your finances, so you always know what it means for you.\n\nSHOP\nWe’ll show you financial products, and provide access to the Nerds' ratings and reviews for each one.\n\nDisclosures:\n\nNerdWallet privacy policy: https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/privacy-policy\n\nNerdWallet terms:\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/p/terms-of-use\n\n*The boosted 4.40% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is offered on up to $250,000 in deposits for the first 6 months when you open a Cash Account offered by Atomic Brokerage LLC and deposit funds within 14 days. Balances above $250,000 will earn the standard 3.75% APY. After the 6 month introductory period, all balances will earn the standard 3.75% APY. The 4.40% boosted introductory APY is available through NerdWallet’s promotional program. APYs are accurate as of 09/23/2025 and are subject to change without notice.\n\nPaid Non-Client Promotion for the Treasury Account and Automated Investing: NerdWallet has engaged Atomic Invest LLC (“Atomic”), an SEC-registered investment adviser, to bring you the opportunity to open an investment advisory account with Atomic. NerdWallet receives compensation of 0% to 0.85% of assets under management annualized, payable monthly, for each referred client who opens an Atomic account and a percentage of free cash interest earned by clients, which creates a conflict of interest. \n\nBrokerage services for Atomic are provided by Atomic Brokerage LLC, a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC and an affiliate of Atomic, which creates a conflict of interest. For more details about Atomic, please go to https://www.atomicvest.com/atomicinvest. For more details about Atomic Brokerage, please go to https://www.atomicvest.com/atomicbrokerage. You can check the background of Atomic Brokerage on FINRA’s BrokerCheck at https://brokercheck.finra.org/. \n\nPaid Non-Client Promotion for the Cash Account: You can open a Cash Account offered by Atomic Brokerage LLC which allows you to earn interest on your cash through a cash sweep program. See important Cash Account disclosures at https://www.atomicvest.com/legal/disclosures/7d9c31dd-bf97-46ae-9803-1774b97187af. Atomic Brokerage shares fees from the cash sweep program banks with NerdWallet for each referred client who opens a Cash Account, which creates a conflict of interest.\n\nNeither Atomic Invest nor Atomic Brokerage, nor any of their affiliates is a bank.

Stay in control of your loan and keep tabs on your progress.\n\nAn active OneMain account is required to use this app. To apply for a new personal loan, visit OMF.com.\n\n\nAPP FEATURES\n\n- Make loan payments on the go.\n\n- Turn on AutoPay to schedule automatic payments.\n\n- Sign up for paperless statements and payment alerts.\n\n- Monitor your VantageScore (R) (updated monthly).\n\n- Access Trim by OneMain (R) to track your spending and even save some cash.\n\nNote: Deleting this app does not close or delete a OneMain account. As a regulated lender and financial institution, we must retain certain records under applicable law. \nABOUT ONEMAIN FINANCIAL\n\nWe provide personal loans that can help you get the money you need, for purposes such as:\n\n\t- Debt consolidation\n\n\t- Home improvement\n\t- Auto purchase or repair\n\n\t- Vacations\n\n\t- Emergencies\n\n\t- Major purchases\n\n\nOur minimum and maximum loan repayment periods are 24 months and 60 months. The maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for a personal loan is 35.99%. Minimum and maximum loan amounts are $1,500 and $20,000.\n\nNot all applicants qualify for larger loan amounts or most favorable loan terms. Larger loan amounts require a first lien on a motor vehicle no more than 10 years old that meets our value requirements, titled in your name with valid insurance. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on your state of residence and your ability to meet our credit standards (including a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses and availability of collateral). APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Highly qualified applicants may be offered higher loan amounts and/or lower APRs. Loan proceeds cannot be used for post-secondary educational expenses, for any business or commercial purpose, to buy cryptocurrency or other speculative investments, or for gambling or illegal purposes. Active-duty military, their spouse or dependents covered by the Military Lending Act may not pledge a vehicle as collateral.\n\nBorrowers in these states are subject to these minimum loan sizes: Alabama: $2,100. California: $3,000. Georgia: $3,100. North Dakota: $2,000. Ohio: $2,000. Virginia: $2,600. \n\nBorrowers in these states are subject to these maximum loan sizes: North Carolina: $11,000 for unsecured loans to all customers; $11,000 for secured loans to present customers. Maine: $7,000. Mississippi: $12,000. West Virginia: $13,500. Loans to purchase a motor vehicle or powersports equipment from select ME, MS, and NC dealerships are not subject to these maximum loan sizes.\n\nWe charge loan origination fees. Depending on the state where you open the loan, the fee may be a flat amount or percentage of the loan amount. Flat fee amounts vary by state, ranging from $25–$500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1%–10% of the loan, subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. \n\nExample Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07.\nWhen refinancing or consolidating existing debts, total finance charges over the life of the new loan may be higher than your current debt because the interest rate may be higher and/or the loan term may be longer. Our loans include origination fees, which may reduce the amount of money available to pay off other debts. \n\nState Licenses: OneMain Financial Group, LLC (NMLS# 1339418).

      "description": "Access your Mariner Finance Customer Account Center on the go. With the Mariner Finance mobile app, you can: \n\n•\tMonitor your account activity;\n•\tSet up auto pay to never miss a payment;\n•\tMake a monthly payment on your existing loan; \n•\tApply for a new loan; \n•\tSee your current offers; \n•\tLocate a branch near you; \n•\tAnd more! \n\nThe Mariner Finance mobile app is designed for Mariner Finance customers and requires a loan account in order to log into the app. Mariner Finance, LLC is a Non Bank Financial Company and is a Loan Processor offering Personal Consumer Loans. Mariner Finance utilizes Bank of America as our main registered bank ACH processor.\n\nA personal loan from Mariner Finance can meet a variety of needs, including home improvement projects, vacations, weddings, debt consolidation, and unplanned expenses. We offer personal loans from $1,000 to $25,000, with loans terms from 12 to 60 months. APR's range from 20.99% to 35.99%. Minimum and maximum amounts dependent on an applicant’s state of residence and the underwriting of the loan.\n\nThe stated APR represents the cost of credit as a yearly rate and will be determined based upon the applicant’s credit at the time of application, subject to state law limits. The stated APR represents the range of APR’s that may be applicable, subject to state law limits and individual underwriting. Not all applicants will qualify for a lower rate. APR’s are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle, and the lowest rates typically apply to the most creditworthy borrowers. All terms and conditions of a loan offer, including the APR, will be disclosed during the application process. As an example, with an amount financed of $5,000.00 the borrower receives $5,000.00 at an APR of 31.99% and an interest rate of 30.76% which includes a finance charge of $3,922.72. Under these terms, the borrower would make 48 monthly payments of $185.89, for a total of payments of $8,922.72. The amount financed may not be the net proceeds paid if charges other than interest are included in the loan.",

With the Mariner Finance mobile app, you can: \n\n•\tMonitor your account activity;\n•\tSet up auto pay to never miss a payment;\n•\tMake a monthly payment on your existing loan; \n•\tApply for a new loan; \n•\tSee your current offers; \n•\tLocate a branch near you; \n•\tAnd more! \n\nThe Mariner Finance mobile app is designed for Mariner Finance customers and requires a loan account in order to log into the app. Mariner Finance, LLC is a Non Bank Financial Company and is a Loan Processor offering Personal Consumer Loans. Mariner Finance utilizes Bank of America as our main registered bank ACH processor.\n\nA personal loan from Mariner Finance can meet a variety of needs, including home improvement projects, vacations, weddings, debt consolidation, and unplanned expenses. We offer personal loans from $1,000 to $25,000, with loans terms from 12 to 60 months. APR's range from 20.99% to 35.99%. Minimum and maximum amounts dependent on an applicant’s state of residence and the underwriting of the loan.\n\nThe stated APR represents the cost of credit as a yearly rate and will be determined based upon the applicant’s credit at the time of application, subject to state law limits. The stated APR represents the range of APR’s that may be applicable, subject to state law limits and individual underwriting. Not all applicants will qualify for a lower rate. APR’s are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle, and the lowest rates typically apply to the most creditworthy borrowers. All terms and conditions of a loan offer, including the APR, will be disclosed during the application process. As an example, with an amount financed of $5,000.00 the borrower receives $5,000.00 at an APR of 31.99% and an interest rate of 30.76% which includes a finance charge of $3,922.72. Under these terms, the borrower would make 48 monthly payments of $185.89, for a total of payments of $8,922.72. The amount financed may not be the net proceeds paid if charges other than interest are included in the loan.",

      "description": "dub is like Instagram for investing.\n\n1. You can copy other investors: copy trade Insiders, Hedge Fund Managers, top traders on Twitter / X, and more!\n2. OR you can get copied: anyone can make a stock portfolio, publish it, and get copied by other dub users.\n\nHOW DO YOU COPY?\n- A portfolio is a basket of stocks, like an ETF.\n- Copy a portfolio with any amount of $, the same way you buy a single stock. Then you buy each stock in the portfolio at its % weight.\n- When the portfolio you copy trades, you automatically trade at the same time and price.\n\nCOPY PORTFOLIOS MADE BY OTHER USERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n- Today, you can copy influential finance personalities from platforms like X (Twitter) or SeekingAlpha and current/former Hedge Fund managers.\n- We also have portfolios built by users that model 13F and public filings from hedge fund managers and insiders.\n- Soon you can also copy your friends, family, or any user on the platform!\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN PORTFOLIO\n- Anyone can create their portfolio for others to copy or for personal money management.\n- Build investment strategies with access to thousands of US stocks leveraging fractional investing technology.\n\nSHARE YOUR PORTFOLIO AND COMPETE WITH OTHERS\n- Show off your investing skills by making a portfolio others can copy!\n- Discover great investors by seeing validated & real-time performance and track records.\n- Compete against other users and friends to see who has the better portfolio.\n\nINVEST WITH AS LITTLE AS $100\n- The minimum deposit is just $100 to start copying a portfolio.\n- We strive to make dub available to all investors.\n\ndub Premium\n- Premium is a paid platform subscription that gives you access to unlimited copying of portfolios and making portfolios\n- Without Premium: you can browse and learn about portfolios and their trading styles\n- Free Trial: everyone gets one week free of Premium\n- Subscription Plans: Premium comes in either a monthly or annual plan\n\nTerms of Use: https://support.dubapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/17915510560155-Terms-of-Use\n\nSubscription Agreement: https://support.dubapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/23862671632027-dub-Platform-Subscription-Agreement",
