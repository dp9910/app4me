      "description": "Welcome to the new Bodybuilding.com app.  \n\nDesigned with seven different ways to workout, trackable health metrics, a customized social experience and an in-app shopping hub for your supplements needs, the BBCOM app is the key to unlocking your true potential. Though don’t just take our word for it. Dive into why you should download the Bodybuilding.com app now.\n\n1. Choose Your Workout Experience  \nFollow along with guided workouts led by our coaches, choose an accessory, dive into a multi-week program, design your own workout/progrram, stack your experiences, or learn new moves with our movement library. There’s a way to work out for everyone. \n \nOur team of Master Coaches consists of accredited professionals with decades of experience. They’ll lead multiple modalities ranging from strength and hypertrophy to body recomp and performance. Need a time out? Pause a workout at any time to watch the movement tutorial without exiting. Time for a rest day? Jump into an accessory to take a breathwork, stretching or mobility sequence.  \n \nTake planning into your own hands by constructing a workout or program specific to you. Build out your calendar using the move library or stack pre-existing workouts together. Find your routine with endless possibilities.\n\n2. Connect With Likeminded Users\nChasing goals requires support, and when it comes to finding support, community is king. Build your profile, share content, and scroll the feed to find your favorite lifters, workouts, and accounts. \n \nDon’t want to share with the world? No sweat. Set your profile to private and accept invites when they come. You’ll be able to like, comment, share and save content in your feed. Stay tuned for our “Groups” feature coming in 2025- where locals can plan meetups IRL, because nothing beats training together.\n\n3. Track Metrics and Store Data\nStored in your profile, connect to Health Kit or Google Health Services to stay on top of heart rate, calories, and other key metrics. Trying to break down your splits? “Blue Man” is here to help track which muscle groups you’ve worked this week to help inform your next workout selection. \n \nWe’ll be revealing fitness devices eligible for syncing in 2025.\n\n4. Earn Badges and Rewards\nIt’s true, we’re all still utterly obsessed with collecting badges, and you can collect a set of your very own in the app. From “total weight lifted” milestones, to streak celebrations and limited-edition holiday badges, there’s a new goal to chase every month. Don’t worry, we reward recovery warriors, too.  \n \nBe on the lookout for future badge releases. Have a concept? Hit up our team to bring your badge to life.\n\n5. Shop Supplements\nYes, you’ll be able to shop for your favorite supplements directly in the app. Did we mention it’s as easy as one click? Annual members will be eligible to year-round free shipping on orders, 10% off our Signature™ line (+ ALL its new products), and if you join now, you’ll earn a $49.99 product coupon to kickstart your journey.  The ease of merging supps with your workout plan is here.  \n \nLater this year we’ll be activating a feature that helps you track when it’s time to restock based on your workout routine.\n\n== Subscriptions and Terms ==\nThe Bodybuilding.com Fitness app offers two auto-renewing All-Access subscription options: monthly and yearly plans.\n\nAnnual: $59.99\nMonthly: $9.99\n\nThe subscription is auto-renewable. This means that it will automatically renew unless you turn off auto renewal in account settings in the App Store after purchase. We also offer a one month free trial to new subscribers so that they can start making gains right away.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Welcome to the new Bodybuilding.com app.  \n\nDesigned with seven different ways to workout, trackable health metrics, a customized social experience and an in-app shopping hub for your supplements needs, the BBCOM app is the key to unlocking your true potential. Though don’t just take our word for it. Dive into why you should download the Bodybuilding.com app now.\n\n1. Choose Your Workout Experience  \nFollow along with guided workouts led by our coaches, choose an accessory, dive into a multi-week program, design your own workout/progrram, stack your experiences, or learn new moves with our movement library. There’s a way to work out for everyone. \n \nOur team of Master Coaches consists of accredited professionals with decades of experience. They’ll lead multiple modalities ranging from strength and hypertrophy to body recomp and performance. Need a time out? Pause a workout at any time to watch the movement tutorial without exiting. Time for a rest day? Jump into an accessory to take a breathwork, stretching or mobility sequence.  \n \nTake planning into your own hands by constructing a workout or program specific to you. Build out your calendar using the move library or stack pre-existing workouts together. Find your routine with endless possibilities.\n\n2. Connect With Likeminded Users\nChasing goals requires support, and when it comes to finding support, community is king. Build your profile, share content, and scroll the feed to find your favorite lifters, workouts, and accounts. \n \nDon’t want to share with the world? No sweat. Set your profile to private and accept invites when they come. You’ll be able to like, comment, share and save content in your feed. Stay tuned for our “Groups” feature coming in 2025- where locals can plan meetups IRL, because nothing beats training together.\n\n3. Track Metrics and Store Data\nStored in your profile, connect to Health Kit or Google Health Services to stay on top of heart rate, calories, and other key metrics. Trying to break down your splits? “Blue Man” is here to help track which muscle groups you’ve worked this week to help inform your next workout selection. \n \nWe’ll be revealing fitness devices eligible for syncing in 2025.\n\n4. Earn Badges and Rewards\nIt’s true, we’re all still utterly obsessed with collecting badges, and you can collect a set of your very own in the app. From “total weight lifted” milestones, to streak celebrations and limited-edition holiday badges, there’s a new goal to chase every month. Don’t worry, we reward recovery warriors, too.  \n \nBe on the lookout for future badge releases. Have a concept? Hit up our team to bring your badge to life.\n\n5. Shop Supplements\nYes, you’ll be able to shop for your favorite supplements directly in the app. Did we mention it’s as easy as one click? Annual members will be eligible to year-round free shipping on orders, 10% off our Signature™ line (+ ALL its new products), and if you join now, you’ll earn a $49.99 product coupon to kickstart your journey.  The ease of merging supps with your workout plan is here.  \n \nLater this year we’ll be activating a feature that helps you track when it’s time to restock based on your workout routine.\n\n== Subscriptions and Terms ==\nThe Bodybuilding.com Fitness app offers two auto-renewing All-Access subscription options: monthly and yearly plans.\n\nAnnual: $59.99\nMonthly: $9.99\n\nThe subscription is auto-renewable. This means that it will automatically renew unless you turn off auto renewal in account settings in the App Store after purchase. We also offer a one month free trial to new subscribers so that they can start making gains right away.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

You’ll always have 2 weeks' worth of classes on your schedule with the flexibility to skip or move them around. \n\n20+ CLASS TYPES: Bye, boring exercise. Build your foundation with strength, sweat it out with cardio, and unwind with recovery. Filter classes by duration, equipment type, body focus, impact, level, or music type to find your perfect match. \n\nSculpt | Strength | Dance Exercise | Pilates | Yoga | HIIT | Barre | Stretch | Cardio Boxing | Bounce | Ride | Step | Meditation | Run | Breathwork | Endurance | Foam Roll | Walk | Yoga Sculpt | Prenatal Workout | Kids Workout \n\nONE-STOP FITNESS FOR WOMEN: Discover what works best for your body with cycle syncing, cycle tracking + insights, pelvic floor exercises, wellness practices, strength training for women, prenatal + postnatal workouts, and more. \n\nSUPERCHARGE YOUR HEALTH: Our class plans and programs can change your body composition, boost cardiovascular health, balance hormone health, and slow aging while boosting longevity.

Some of the reasons? Not knowing where to start, thinking fitness is all-or-nothing (thanks, diet culture), juggling endless responsibilities, and being told we all build habits the same way. obé is here to change that. \n\nA subscription is required to use the obé app. Sign up for an auto-renewable monthly or annual subscription to access all live and on-demand video content.

Did we mention he loves to eat?\n\nThe thing is – he wants to get fit! To do that he needs your help.\n\nSo be prepared to:\n\n• Get your friend out of bed, and do some physical activities.\n• Get him running on the treadmill, lifting weights, or maybe jumping rope and boxing.\n• Make sure he gets enough food after the workout, and a good night's sleep to recover his stamina.\n• And please – don't forget to have fun!\n\nOther features include:\n\n• Exercise tracking with HealthKit, so if you exercise in real life, your friend will lose weight in the game as well.\n• Funny costumes for your friend, such as a basketball player, clown, soldier and more.\n• Stunning graphics that make playing the game fun each time you pick up your phone.\n• Share your friend's best moments and progress as he keeps losing weight!\n\nDare to take the challenge? Develop that perfect exercise diet that will really help your friend shed the pounds.",

Work out from home, the gym, or anywhere - all at affordable rates.\n \nHOW DOES FLEXIT WORK?\n \nFlexIt has two offerings that enable seamless access to personalized and flexible fitness.\n \nVirtual Personal Training (VPT) is the most personalized, private, and custom digital fitness experience. VPT lets you train live with expert trainers from trusted brands from anywhere in the world.\n \nPlus, FlexIt gives you flexible, pay-as-you-go access to thousands of fitness facilities across the United States. Check-in by scanning the QR code at the front desk and enter the gym without worrying about tours, day passes, or paperwork.\n \nHOW DOES VIRTUAL PERSONAL TRAINING WORK?\n \nTraining virtually with a personal trainer is incredibly simple. Using FlexIt’s video technology, you can take personalized, 1-on-1 training sessions with live trainers. Sessions can be taken from within the FlexIt app or from FlexIt’s website.\n \nEach session is customized specifically for you by your trainer so it’s perfect for your fitness level and goals.\n \nIS VIRTUAL PERSONAL TRAINING EFFECTIVE?\n \nFlexIt VPT has been shown to be extremely effective in helping users build and maintain healthy habits. 88% of users surveyed reported that VPT is significantly more effective than pre-recorded workouts.  73% preferred it to an in-person personal training session. FlexIt VPT has been featured on ABC News, The Today Show, and Men’s Journal.\n \nWHO ARE THE FLEXIT TRAINERS?\n \nFlexIt works with some of the biggest brands in fitness to offer you access to an unprecedented variety of trainers and fitness styles. By working out with FlexIt, you can be sure you’re getting the best. Our trainers specialize in all fitness styles including strength training, cardio, yoga, and pilates.  Plus, get comprehensive health support like diet and nutrition guidance, meditation, and pre / post natal care.\n \nHOW DOES FLEXIT’S FLEXIBLE GYM ACCESS WORK?\n \nVisiting a FlexIt gym is seamless, flexible, and paper-free with no additional waiver or FlexIt membership required. Here’s how it works:\n \n - Search for gym or fitness studios on the FlexIt app.\n - Once you arrive at a gym, use the app to scan the QR mount at the front desk to check-in: no waiver required.\n - When you’re ready to leave, simply check out and pay only for the time you were there.",

      "description": "Train Fitness is the first app to offer automatic exercise tracking, using only the motion of your Apple Watch. Trusted by 100,000+ weight lifters, Train Fitness is the future of AI + gym workouts.\n\nOur application monitors the motion of your Apple Watch, tracking reps for over 470 unique exercise types – completely hands free! Our app will track push ups, bicep curls, 12 types of bench press, squats, deadlifts, and hundreds more! No more manually logging each set.\n\nThis automatic tracking is made possible by our patented Neural Kinetic Profiling, an advancement in AI that allows workout tracking using wrist motion. \n\nUnsure what to do at the gym? Using the Train Fitness app, you can generate workouts based on your recovery, goals, and fitness data with the help of AI. Our Smart Weights system will recommend specific workout plans, exercises, sets, and weight… entirely customized to you! Let artificial intelligence build the best possible workout for you, and stop guessing what to do at the gym.  \n\nWe built Train Fitness because we too are lifters, gym enthusiasts, & fellow athletes, and we're tired of entering a workout log, manually. We believe that a gym workout tracker should be as easy as recording a run, and we’ll stop at nothing to get there. The Train Fitness App is an all-encompassing workout log app that tracks how you move and helps you achieve your strength training goals at the gym. Simply strap on your Apple Watch, and see the magic unfold.\n\nOur application runs on the Apple Watch 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, SE, Apple Watch Ultra, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Unfortunately, we do not support the Apple Watch 1, 2 and 3.\n\nWe are very serious about data. Train Fitness will never sell your data to third parties. Our data storage practices are designed to enhance user experience without compromising privacy. We only retain the essential data needed for a seamless experience.

Previously, if a workout was saved while offline, it was taking longer than expected for the workout to upload. This version fixes this so these workouts are uploaded as soon as possible.\n- Fix for the watch screen freezing occasionally while confirming sets.\n- Fix for workout recovery on watch sometimes not recovering the entire workout (when the watch app is closed / opened during a workout)\n\nWe value community feedback immensely. If you'd like to share feedback, report bugs, schedule a live call with our engineering team, or otherwise give us your thoughts on the app, you can do so directly from the Train Fitness iPhone app from: Profile (You) Tab > Settings > Get Involved.\nHappy lifting!",

        "description": "Train Fitness is the first app to offer automatic exercise tracking, using only the motion of your Apple Watch. Trusted by 100,000+ weight lifters, Train Fitness is the future of AI + gym workouts.\n\nOur application monitors the motion of your Apple Watch, tracking reps for over 470 unique exercise types – completely hands free! Our app will track push ups, bicep curls, 12 types of bench press, squats, deadlifts, and hundreds more! No more manually logging each set.\n\nThis automatic tracking is made possible by our patented Neural Kinetic Profiling, an advancement in AI that allows workout tracking using wrist motion. \n\nUnsure what to do at the gym? Using the Train Fitness app, you can generate workouts based on your recovery, goals, and fitness data with the help of AI. Our Smart Weights system will recommend specific workout plans, exercises, sets, and weight… entirely customized to you! Let artificial intelligence build the best possible workout for you, and stop guessing what to do at the gym.  \n\nWe built Train Fitness because we too are lifters, gym enthusiasts, & fellow athletes, and we're tired of entering a workout log, manually. We believe that a gym workout tracker should be as easy as recording a run, and we’ll stop at nothing to get there. The Train Fitness App is an all-encompassing workout log app that tracks how you move and helps you achieve your strength training goals at the gym. Simply strap on your Apple Watch, and see the magic unfold.\n\nOur application runs on the Apple Watch 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, SE, Apple Watch Ultra, and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Unfortunately, we do not support the Apple Watch 1, 2 and 3.\n\nWe are very serious about data. Train Fitness will never sell your data to third parties. Our data storage practices are designed to enhance user experience without compromising privacy. We only retain the essential data needed for a seamless experience. Please see our Privacy Policy & Commitment below for more details.\n\nAny purchases will be applied to your iCloud account at the end of your free trial. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime directly from your iCloud account, or on the Train Fitness application.
