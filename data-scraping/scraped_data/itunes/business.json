      "description": "\"A driver’s co-pilot\" - The New York Times\n\nTrusted by over 4 million drivers, freelancers, and small business owners.\nEverlance automatically tracks your miles, captures expenses, and uncovers tax deductions.\nSave thousands a year on average in taxes and reimbursements.\nPartners include DoorDash, Lyft, Thumbtack, Wag!, Shipt, Realtor associations, and more\n\nWhether you’re delivering food, managing clients, or running your own business, Everlance is your companion on the road, keeping your records organized, your taxes simple, and your reimbursements accurate.\n\nLog every trip automatically, connect your bank or card to capture expenses, uncover hidden savings with Deduction Finder, generate IRS-ready reports, and even file your 1099 taxes in-app. With $1M audit protection in Professional, you’re covered on every drive.\n\n▶ WHY EVERLANCE\n\nMost mileage apps stop at tracking trips. Everlance goes further, giving you peace of mind that every mile and every expense is accounted for. From fuel and tolls to supplies and parking, you’ll always be tax-ready without the stress.\n\n→ \"Everlance is easier and more intuitive than many other mileage trackers. The app syncs with your phone’s GPS and tracks your mileage for you automatically. From there, you can easily label trips as personal or work-related\" -  U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\n▶ WHAT YOU GET\n\n• Automatic GPS mileage tracking in the background\n• Easy expense capture by linking your card or snapping receipts\n• Deduction Finder to uncover extra write-offs instantly\n• IRS-compliant reports for taxes or reimbursements\n• Optional 1099 tax filing and $1M Audit Protection in Professional\n\n→ \"What makes it especially great for the self-employed is its assistance in managing taxes.

For 2025, the IRS rate is 70 cents per mile, that’s $700 for every 1,000 miles. Missing even a few trips could mean hundreds or thousands lost at tax time.\n\nEverlance makes sure nothing slips through the cracks. With every mile logged, every receipt stored, and every deduction captured, your records are always complete and ready for tax season.\n\n→ \"If you operate a solo business, Everlance could become your new favorite app\" - The College Investor\n\n▶ WHO IT'S FOR\n\nIf you drive your own vehicle for work or charity, Everlance was built for you.\n\n• Delivery & rideshare drivers (DoorDash, Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Shipt)\n• Freelancers and contractors juggling multiple clients\n• Real estate agents and field sales reps\n• Small business owners looking for an all-in-one tax tool\n• Employees getting reimbursed for mileage\n• Nonprofit volunteers tracking charitable miles\n\n→ \"Everlance is by far the best option I’ve found, combining a simple, attractive interface with a price that’s impossible to beat.

      "description": "A business card is the first impression of your brand. Every professional needs a business card or a visiting card. \n\nHere is the business card maker app that helps you to create creative business cards.\n\nKey Features\n- Insert texts like your name, company name, mobile number, email address, website, etc... \n- Select your business card from various business card designs.\n- Custom Design Editor\n- Save or Share business card\n- Save your business time without any designer.\n\nWhen you meet someone that could potentially be a great prospect or connection, don’t you want him or her to walk away with a great first impression?\nA memorable business card does a lot more than just pass on an email address or phone number.\n\nCreative business cards get shared -- continuing to market for you.\n\nA business card is a physical object that a potential prospect leaves the encounter with. Your brand stays with them.\n\nIf you meet a prospect and exchange email addresses and phone numbers you each walk away with another contact on your mobile phone -- it ends there. If you hand over a creative business card that makes a great impression that a person is likely to show it to other people -- putting you and your brand in front of additional prospects.\n\nBusiness cards show you are prepared.\n\nThe Importance of Business Cards For Professionals\n\n1. Business cards give people the ability to follow up\n\n2. Business cards show that you are a professional\n3. Having a business card keeps one focused on the goal\n4. Business cards can help make you referable\n5. Luck happens when preparation meets opportunity.\n\nIn saying that make sure that you always have your business cards with you so when the opportunity comes you are already prepared and you too may get “lucky” and find success.\n\nBusiness cards put a face to a business – When meeting someone new, handing them your business card (preferably with your photo on it) will help keep your business in the back of their minds. Though they may not need your product or services today, there may come a time when they do, and hopefully, they will be able to pull out your business card and call versus trying to remember your company name and searching the web.\n\nHow to create your professional business card?\n- Incorporate QR codes in your business card\n- Spend more on quality\n- Choose the right font\n- Consider professional help\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to any of the “Business Card Maker Pro” Subscriptions, the payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. any unused portion of the free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication. From that moment and further, the subscription automatically renews until auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. You may manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your account settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active period.

        "description": "A business card is the first impression of your brand. Every professional needs a business card or a visiting card. \n\nHere is the business card maker app that helps you to create creative business cards.\n\nKey Features\n- Insert texts like your name, company name, mobile number, email address, website, etc... \n- Select your business card from various business card designs.\n- Custom Design Editor\n- Save or Share business card\n- Save your business time without any designer.\n\nWhen you meet someone that could potentially be a great prospect or connection, don’t you want him or her to walk away with a great first impression?\nA memorable business card does a lot more than just pass on an email address or phone number.\n\nCreative business cards get shared -- continuing to market for you.\n\nA business card is a physical object that a potential prospect leaves the encounter with. Your brand stays with them.\n\nIf you meet a prospect and exchange email addresses and phone numbers you each walk away with another contact on your mobile phone -- it ends there. If you hand over a creative business card that makes a great impression that a person is likely to show it to other people -- putting you and your brand in front of additional prospects.\n\nBusiness cards show you are prepared.\n\nThe Importance of Business Cards For Professionals\n\n1. Business cards give people the ability to follow up\n\n2. Business cards show that you are a professional\n3. Having a business card keeps one focused on the goal\n4. Business cards can help make you referable\n5. Luck happens when preparation meets opportunity.\n\nIn saying that make sure that you always have your business cards with you so when the opportunity comes you are already prepared and you too may get “lucky” and find success.\n\nBusiness cards put a face to a business – When meeting someone new, handing them your business card (preferably with your photo on it) will help keep your business in the back of their minds. Though they may not need your product or services today, there may come a time when they do, and hopefully, they will be able to pull out your business card and call versus trying to remember your company name and searching the web.\n\nHow to create your professional business card?\n- Incorporate QR codes in your business card\n- Spend more on quality\n- Choose the right font\n- Consider professional help\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to any of the “Business Card Maker Pro” Subscriptions, the payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. any unused portion of the free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication.
