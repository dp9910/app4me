Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common.

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common. Synthetic estrogens in birth control, plastics, and beauty products have created hormone imbalances for millions of women. 28's functional nutrition was designed to naturally restore balance to your hormones, along with phase-specific functional movements. \n\nWorkout With Your Cycle, Not Against It\n\n\nMany popular fitness methods were designed for men, not women, with no regard for the menstrual cycle. 28 is the first method of its kind designed to optimize your energy, hormones, strength, and flexibility as you experience changes throughout your cycle.\n\nYou Deserve More Than A Period Tracker\n\nYour cycle has four phases. Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn't have to be. We've been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\n28 offers different subscription plans. Payment will be charged to the credit card connected to your iTunes Account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.

      "description": "Liven is your self-discovery companion, a system of tools designed to help you better understand and transform yourself. \n\nWHO’S LIVEN FOR?  \n• For you, me, anyone trying to survive in this hyperstimulated world.    \n• For those under pressure, living to meet others’ expectations, or struggling to say ‘no’.  \n• For those wanting to build a positive self-image, improve focus, or manage time.  \n• For anyone ready to liven up!\n\nAre you ready to take your inner dialogue out of your head and gain a new perspective on life? Because if you are, we’ve got tools to help you observe your experiences and reframe your days. Sounds good?\n\n  \n\nCHECK OUT OUR APPROACH:\n\n• Personalized program\n\nSet a clear, achievable goal—whether it's improving your self-image, saying \"no,\" or challenging negative thoughts. Choose your direction, and we'll help you get there with evidence-based techniques and tools. \n\n• Mood tracker\n\nPause during the day to check in with your emotions. See how you're doing—Good, Bad, Amazing! Use our emotional menu to name your feelings, notice what triggered them, and track changes over time with the Mood Calendar.\n\n• Routine builder\n\nCheck out our Tasks tool to plan new activities and get ideas for things to try each day. By adding new tasks and routines to your days, you can change your behaviour and transform.   \n\n• AI companion\n\nEver wish someone would listen to you rant without judgment, even at 3 a.m.? Meet Livie, our AI companion. If you're tired of the inner dialogue or need a fresh perspective on life, just talk to her. She'll help you break down your situations and suggest new ideas to try.  \n\n• Bite-size knowledge\n\nScientists have studied the human mind for over 100 years, uncovering how our emotions, thoughts, and actions connect to unconscious \"auto-pilot\" behaviors. We've distilled this knowledge into bite-sized insights for you to apply in your decision-making.     \n\n• Well-being tests\n\nEveryone loves quizzes! Take a break and answer a set of questions to define experiences you’re going through. Check back every week to track the changes in emotional and behavioural dynamics.        \n\n• Deep focus soundscapes\n\nWhen you don’t feel like listening to music but still want to wear headphones and block out the world, try our soundscapes.\n\n———————\n\nWHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING ABOUT US\n\n\"Positive thoughts and a calmer attitude come after 10 minutes of use.\"\n\n\"Great app to use as a guide at the start of your day.\"\n\n\"Liven is helping me turn healthy activities into habits.\"\n\n———————\nSUBSCRIPTION AND TERMS\nAfter you decide to begin your growth with Liven and download the app, you can unlock all features by subscribing to the premium subscription.\nIf you choose to purchase a premium subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

        "description": "Liven is your self-discovery companion, a system of tools designed to help you better understand and transform yourself. \n\nWHO’S LIVEN FOR?  \n• For you, me, anyone trying to survive in this hyperstimulated world.    \n• For those under pressure, living to meet others’ expectations, or struggling to say ‘no’.  \n• For those wanting to build a positive self-image, improve focus, or manage time.  \n• For anyone ready to liven up!\n\nAre you ready to take your inner dialogue out of your head and gain a new perspective on life? Because if you are, we’ve got tools to help you observe your experiences and reframe your days. Sounds good?\n\n  \n\nCHECK OUT OUR APPROACH:\n\n• Personalized program\n\nSet a clear, achievable goal—whether it's improving your self-image, saying \"no,\" or challenging negative thoughts. Choose your direction, and we'll help you get there with evidence-based techniques and tools. \n\n• Mood tracker\n\nPause during the day to check in with your emotions. See how you're doing—Good, Bad, Amazing! Use our emotional menu to name your feelings, notice what triggered them, and track changes over time with the Mood Calendar.\n\n• Routine builder\n\nCheck out our Tasks tool to plan new activities and get ideas for things to try each day. By adding new tasks and routines to your days, you can change your behaviour and transform.   \n\n• AI companion\n\nEver wish someone would listen to you rant without judgment, even at 3 a.m.? Meet Livie, our AI companion. If you're tired of the inner dialogue or need a fresh perspective on life, just talk to her. She'll help you break down your situations and suggest new ideas to try.  \n\n• Bite-size knowledge\n\nScientists have studied the human mind for over 100 years, uncovering how our emotions, thoughts, and actions connect to unconscious \"auto-pilot\" behaviors. We've distilled this knowledge into bite-sized insights for you to apply in your decision-making.     \n\n• Well-being tests\n\nEveryone loves quizzes! Take a break and answer a set of questions to define experiences you’re going through. Check back every week to track the changes in emotional and behavioural dynamics.        \n\n• Deep focus soundscapes\n\nWhen you don’t feel like listening to music but still want to wear headphones and block out the world, try our soundscapes.\n\n———————\n\nWHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING ABOUT US\n\n\"Positive thoughts and a calmer attitude come after 10 minutes of use.\"\n\n\"Great app to use as a guide at the start of your day.\"\n\n\"Liven is helping me turn healthy activities into habits.\"\n\n———————\nSUBSCRIPTION AND TERMS\nAfter you decide to begin your growth with Liven and download the app, you can unlock all features by subscribing to the premium subscription.\nIf you choose to purchase a premium subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

        "description": "Traditional workouts aren't for everyone. And that's OK! With EasyWellness, you can craft your own personal *glow up*. EasyWellness helps you build fundamental habits so you can improve your flexibility, mobility, stress management, sleep, lung health, cardiovascular health, water intake, digestion and even cardio — in just a few minutes per day.\nYou don't need to sweat it out in a gym or run a marathon to be healthy— wellness can be easy, and we show you how. \n\nWith enhanced INSIGHTS, you can track all your EasyWellness stats and see how you've progressed. Check your progress with weekly and monthly statistics in graphs and highlights. Tracking your progress is one of the best tools to achieve your goals.\n\nIf you’re trying to get healthier, but keep quitting when life gets in the way, you can benefit from EasyWellness. We’ve got programs to help you on the road to a healthier life – Stretching Routines, Breathing Exercises, Water Tracker, Step Counter and the Wellness Library. \n\nHOW DOES EASYWELLNESS WORK?\nEasyWellness programs are fundamental to your health. These are habits that you CAN keep up! They don’t require a huge time or energy commitment. Add a little EasyWellness to your day and you will reap the benefits in the long term.\n\n#Stretching - Improve flexibility and mobility. No matter your age or body type, flexibility and mobility are the key to completing daily activities easily and without injury. Stretching can also improve with pain and posture.\n\n#Breathing - There is no denying that stress and sleep are huge factors in our overall health. Breathing exercises are a powerful tool in stress reduction and better sleep. Our app will guide you through these exercises so you can be at your best.\n\n#Hydration - Staying hydrated and drinking more water can be difficult, but not with our water tracker. Improve digestion and curb cravings when you hit your daily water needs.\n\n#Movement - Walking has incredible benefits as a form of exercise and is low impact: It helps with weight management, cardiovascular health and can boost your mood. The EasyWellness Step Counter helps beginners create the habit of walking more throughout their day.\n\n#Wellness Library - Articles, tips and quizzes to help you along your wellness journey. \n\nBENEFITS:\n- Change your approach towards healthy living with simple programs you can do regularly\n- Loosen tight muscles\n- Improve flexibility, mobility and balance\n- Gently fight the effects of aging\n- Easily combined with your personalized nutritional needs\n- Boost energy\n- No burnout\n- Sleep better\n- Improve focus and concentration\n- Increase lung capacity\n- Curb cravings\n- Reduce stress and increase mindfulness and more!\n\n** Taking motivation out of the equation! ** \nMotivation isn’t something that we can rely on when it comes to getting healthier and self care. That’s why EasyWellness has customizable time frames. Do what you can and keep up your streak! \n\nMORE FEATURES:\n- Create your own stretch routines: Users can now create their own routines with the Create Your Own Mix feature. This is perfect for people with injuries that need to work on (or avoid) certain areas.\n- Weekly and monthly insights show how you've progressed. \n- Audio, Visual Graphics and Text Instructions\n- Haptic Vibrations for discrete breathing exercises\n- Friendly reminders\n- Easy scheduling calendar\n- Challenges, streaks and achievement badges\n- Dark mode for night time stretching, breathing exercises and browsing\n\nJOIN THE COMMUNITY\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easywellness.app\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/easywellnessapp\nContact: support@littlebylittlelabs.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.easywellness.app/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.easywellness.app/privacy\n\nCopyright © 2021 LITTLE BY LITTLE LABS LLC",

Yay!\n\nDifferent phases of the menstrual cycle can affect how workout-ready your body feels. Keeping them in view helps keep them in mind and this widget does just that. It shows the current phase, cycle day, and expected readiness.\n\nStill, period is just one piece of your wellbeing picture, something to help you understand your patterns better. How cycle phases affect us varies greatly from person to person. It’s best to observe yourself and add notes with your workouts to learn what’s true for you, and then adapt your behaviour to it.\n\nTo add a period widget (or any other) follow these steps:\n1. Touch and hold an empty spot on your Home Screen until apps start jiggling.\n2. Tap the + or Edit button (depending on your iOS version).\n3. Search for Gentler Streak and swipe through widgets - the Period one’s last.\n4. Tap Add Widget, and drag to wherever you’d like it to be.\n\nIf you find Gentler Streak helpful, leaving a review on the App Store is one of the best ways to support us. For a small team, your reviews and ratings matter a lot! They help others discover us more easily, and help them understand what to expect from the app. Good ones also make our day.\n\nGot feedback?

Based on your unique needs, activity tracking, and now with Coach: Intelligent recovery planning designed to help you perform – and feel – better every day. \n\nOnce you pair with a compatible Theragun massage gun, SmartGoggles eye and temple massager, SleepMask, RecoveryAir or JetBoots compression pants, WaveRoller, WaveDuo, WaveSolo muscle rollers, ThermBack LED advanced back wrap, or TheraFace PRO LED light and microcurrent facial device, you can start moving towards your fitness, wellness, and skincare goals. \n\n\nA COACH IN YOUR POCKET \n\nPowered by AI, Coach by Therabody creates intelligent, personalized recovery plans based on your fitness goals, activity data, and latest scientific research. Designed for Theragun, Coach updates your recovery plan daily with your activities and changing needs. It notifies you in real-time with customized, science-backed recommendations to help you use your Theragun for more effective recovery. \n\n\nACTIVITY TRACKING AND WEARABLES SYNCING \n\nRecord activities using your favorite health and fitness wearable devices or apps. You can track runs, walks, hikes, bike rides, workouts, yoga, and dozens more. Just sync the Therabody app with your favorite device including Garmin, Apple Health and Strava, and your activities from your connected wearables will sync in real-time so that you have the most effective recovery plan based on your day. \n\n\nMASSAGE GUN TRACKING \n\nTheragun is the only massage gun that syncs your recovery data to a fitness app in real time — tracking therapy types, session length and speed, even when you’re not using the app*. That means you’ll always get credit for your recovery sessions and receive personalized recommendations tailored to your routine.   \n\n\nGUIDED ROUTINES DESIGNED BY EXPERTS \n\nEliminate any guesswork and explore our library of step-by-step guided routines that show exactly how to use your device, where to use it on your body, and for how long. From recovering your legs after a long run, to relieving that pesky back pain after a long workday, you’ll find the treatment you need, designed by our team of science and physiology experts including physical therapists, trainers, chiropractors, and scientists. \n\n\nBLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR ADVANCED CONTROLS \n\nWith Bluetooth connectivity, use the Therabody app to fine-tune your settings with more precise control. Adjust the exact speed of your Theragun, tweak the heat on your SmartGoggles, adjust the LED light for your TheraFace PRO, or soften the vibration of your Wave Roller to provide your body what feels best. Plus, routines will automatically apply any recommended settings and tell you when to switch positions or attachments. \n\n \n*Offline session tracking only available for Theragun PRO Plus, Theragun Prime Plus, Theragun Sense (1st and 2nd Gen), Theragun Prime 6th Gen, and Theragun Mini 3rd Gen.",

Based on your unique needs, activity tracking, and now with Coach: Intelligent recovery planning designed to help you perform – and feel – better every day. \n\nOnce you pair with a compatible Theragun massage gun, SmartGoggles eye and temple massager, SleepMask, RecoveryAir or JetBoots compression pants, WaveRoller, WaveDuo, WaveSolo muscle rollers, ThermBack LED advanced back wrap, or TheraFace PRO LED light and microcurrent facial device, you can start moving towards your fitness, wellness, and skincare goals. \n\n\nA COACH IN YOUR POCKET \n\nPowered by AI, Coach by Therabody creates intelligent, personalized recovery plans based on your fitness goals, activity data, and latest scientific research. Designed for Theragun, Coach updates your recovery plan daily with your activities and changing needs. It notifies you in real-time with customized, science-backed recommendations to help you use your Theragun for more effective recovery. \n\n\nACTIVITY TRACKING AND WEARABLES SYNCING \n\nRecord activities using your favorite health and fitness wearable devices or apps. You can track runs, walks, hikes, bike rides, workouts, yoga, and dozens more. Just sync the Therabody app with your favorite device including Garmin, Apple Health and Strava, and your activities from your connected wearables will sync in real-time so that you have the most effective recovery plan based on your day. \n\n\nMASSAGE GUN TRACKING \n\nTheragun is the only massage gun that syncs your recovery data to a fitness app in real time — tracking therapy types, session length and speed, even when you’re not using the app*. That means you’ll always get credit for your recovery sessions and receive personalized recommendations tailored to your routine.   \n\n\nGUIDED ROUTINES DESIGNED BY EXPERTS \n\nEliminate any guesswork and explore our library of step-by-step guided routines that show exactly how to use your device, where to use it on your body, and for how long. From recovering your legs after a long run, to relieving that pesky back pain after a long workday, you’ll find the treatment you need, designed by our team of science and physiology experts including physical therapists, trainers, chiropractors, and scientists. \n\n\nBLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR ADVANCED CONTROLS \n\nWith Bluetooth connectivity, use the Therabody app to fine-tune your settings with more precise control. Adjust the exact speed of your Theragun, tweak the heat on your SmartGoggles, adjust the LED light for your TheraFace PRO, or soften the vibration of your Wave Roller to provide your body what feels best. Plus, routines will automatically apply any recommended settings and tell you when to switch positions or attachments. \n\n \n*Offline session tracking only available for Theragun PRO Plus, Theragun Prime Plus, Theragun Sense (1st and 2nd Gen), Theragun Prime 6th Gen, and Theragun Mini 3rd Gen.",

      "description": "Being active has never been more rewarding!  CARROT is a free app that rewards you financially for walking. By walking and achieving individualized activity goals, users earn virtual currencies that can be used to play games, compete in challenges, bid on an auction and earn rewards (such as digital gift cards) that are available right on the app. Those rewards can be won in live, real-time “instant” auctions!\n \nCARROT has successfully gamified health and wellness, including several fun features available to all users. “CARROT Survivor” is a last-person-standing competition that challenges contestants to make their personal goals each and every day. “Versus” contests include weekly fantasy football competitions during the fall as well as similar games throughout the year. And CARROT’s “Unlockables” requires you to achieve a personal goal streak to access special prizes.\n \nCARROT offers iPhone users several great features:\n(1) Using Apple HealthKit, CARROT gives you a personalized “Activity Goal”, based on your own activity history, which is updated daily. Push yourself just a little bit more each day, make your personal goals, and then reap the rewards!\n(2) CARROT’s Apple Watch app allows users to conveniently monitor their daily activity progress with just a tap.\n(3) Using iBeacon technology, users can earn bonus Reward Points for activities such as community health programs and for visiting participating businesses. This is done in the background with low-energy Bluetooth.\n(4) And as a fully inclusive program, CARROT provides the opportunity for manual wheelchair users to participate by being rewarded for their “pushes”, rather than “steps”. (Note: The use of an Apple Watch is required to accurately collect push data for use on CARROT.)\n \nAll CARROT users earn one Reward Point for each step they take. Premium Members – including those who are sponsored by their employer through a CARROT Corporate Wellness Program – can also earn CARROTcoins for achieving personalized activity goals. You can get a one-month Premium Membership with an In-App purchase.\n \nWith CARROT, there’s no need to purchase a wearable tracker – everything, including your steps data and rewards, is stored exclusively on your phone. The app doesn’t even have to be on or running for you to earn points. (But if you already own a tracker, CARROT accepts data from most popular devices.)\n \nWould you like your employer to offer CARROT rewards to you and your coworkers? “CARROT Health & Wellness” is a special, low-cost program that offers employees exclusive company-sponsored rewards such as digital gift cards – available directly through the app – just for meeting daily activity goals. Employers can launch their own CARROT Wellness pilot program by entering their information on the CARROT “Wellness” screen.\n \nBecause CARROT respects your privacy, you have the option to sign in using your phone number, Facebook or anonymously. Anonymous (“Guest”) users should beware that, since all data is stored only on the device, you will permanently lose all relevant data and earned rewards if you log out or delete the app.\n \nMany exclusive rewards are made available based on your location, and you can also receive bonus Reward Points for visiting CARROT businesses and other locations -- so please be sure to allow “location services”. (Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.)\n \nEasy to use. Convenient. Personalized. Free. When it comes to Fitness Rewards, nothing beats CARROT!",

        "description": "Being active has never been more rewarding!  CARROT is a free app that rewards you financially for walking. By walking and achieving individualized activity goals, users earn virtual currencies that can be used to play games, compete in challenges, bid on an auction and earn rewards (such as digital gift cards) that are available right on the app. Those rewards can be won in live, real-time “instant” auctions!\n \nCARROT has successfully gamified health and wellness, including several fun features available to all users. “CARROT Survivor” is a last-person-standing competition that challenges contestants to make their personal goals each and every day. “Versus” contests include weekly fantasy football competitions during the fall as well as similar games throughout the year. And CARROT’s “Unlockables” requires you to achieve a personal goal streak to access special prizes.\n \nCARROT offers iPhone users several great features:\n(1) Using Apple HealthKit, CARROT gives you a personalized “Activity Goal”, based on your own activity history, which is updated daily. Push yourself just a little bit more each day, make your personal goals, and then reap the rewards!\n(2) CARROT’s Apple Watch app allows users to conveniently monitor their daily activity progress with just a tap.\n(3) Using iBeacon technology, users can earn bonus Reward Points for activities such as community health programs and for visiting participating businesses. This is done in the background with low-energy Bluetooth.\n(4) And as a fully inclusive program, CARROT provides the opportunity for manual wheelchair users to participate by being rewarded for their “pushes”, rather than “steps”. (Note: The use of an Apple Watch is required to accurately collect push data for use on CARROT.)\n \nAll CARROT users earn one Reward Point for each step they take. Premium Members – including those who are sponsored by their employer through a CARROT Corporate Wellness Program – can also earn CARROTcoins for achieving personalized activity goals. You can get a one-month Premium Membership with an In-App purchase.\n \nWith CARROT, there’s no need to purchase a wearable tracker – everything, including your steps data and rewards, is stored exclusively on your phone. The app doesn’t even have to be on or running for you to earn points. (But if you already own a tracker, CARROT accepts data from most popular devices.)\n \nWould you like your employer to offer CARROT rewards to you and your coworkers? “CARROT Health & Wellness” is a special, low-cost program that offers employees exclusive company-sponsored rewards such as digital gift cards – available directly through the app – just for meeting daily activity goals. Employers can launch their own CARROT Wellness pilot program by entering their information on the CARROT “Wellness” screen.\n \nBecause CARROT respects your privacy, you have the option to sign in using your phone number, Facebook or anonymously. Anonymous (“Guest”) users should beware that, since all data is stored only on the device, you will permanently lose all relevant data and earned rewards if you log out or delete the app.\n \nMany exclusive rewards are made available based on your location, and you can also receive bonus Reward Points for visiting CARROT businesses and other locations -- so please be sure to allow “location services”. (Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.)\n \nEasy to use. Convenient. Personalized. Free. When it comes to Fitness Rewards, nothing beats CARROT!",

      "description": "Rewire stress-based behaviors at the root of your chronic symptoms, release inherited & stored trauma responses, & gently guide your nervous system back to a place of safety, regulation, and genuine ease.\n\nWhat if healing is allowed to be easy? What if it can feel more like play?\n\nTapping with T is both a community of self healers and a playground of tools intended to support you in rewiring your brain and is ultimately here to assist you in healing yourself.\n\nWith a weekly-updated library of EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) tapping videos, breathwork, Non-Sleep Deep Rest, and guided relaxations, Tapping with T supports you to regulate at your own pace.

We were never meant to do this alone and we don't have to. Together, we learn to release what is weighing us down, step into new possibilities, and widen our windows of tolerance with tenderness!\n\nVideos range in length from 5-25 minutes. We cover a wide range of topics including:\n\n~Handling anxiety: about being chronically ill, having food reactions & flare-ups, panic attacks, social events, not being able to sleep, etc.\n\n~Honoring depression: using parts work to see low energy states as opportunities to lean in, learning to move through & release emotions with curiosity.\n\n~Confidence & Body-image: for unwanted weight-gain, unwanted weight-loss, acne, body-acceptance, binge-eating, people-pleasing, and releasing the worry about what people might think.\n\n~Sleep support: for those with insomnia or panic, night sweats, waking up exhausted, brain fog, healing while you sleep, etc.\n\n~Energy support: for chronic fatigue, PMS, fibromyalgia, MCAS, exercise, burn-out, etc.\n\n~Releasing fear: around never getting better, feeling behind, feeling disabled by symptoms, not knowing the next step to take to heal, and more.\n\n~Chronic symptom support: for Lyme & infections, mold, gut disorders, pain, PTSD, food sensitivities, fatigue, sadness, etc.\n\n~Relationship support: for boundaries, communication, finding love, connection.\n\n~Releasing trapped emotions: for healing physical symptoms related to anger, grudges, grief, etc.\n\n~Pregnancy & Postpartum: TTC, depression & fatigue, & traumatic birth experiences.\n\n~Our videos target those with complex cases of chronic illness & trauma wanting to feel grounded, hopeful, and healthy again.\n\nWith each tap, we step out of limbic loops, lower stress, and allow the body to heal & favor continual growth.\n\nThe visitor of our website/app acknowledges that the information available on or through Tapping with T is not a substitute for medical advice.

      "description": "Your New Wellness Starts Here!!!\n\nOur Mission is to promote the health and wellness of LSU Health Shreveport through education and efforts that encourage habits of wellness, inspire and empower individuals to take responsibility for their own health and support a sense of community in which health and overall well-being are recognized as an essential element of success.\n\nEmotional, social, workplace, and physical well-being are critical to the development and maintenance of competent, caring students, faculty, and healthcare providers. In the current healthcare environment, students, residents, fellows, faculty members, and staff are at increased risk for burnout and depression. Self-care is an important component that impacts the quality of life and work. It is also a skill that must be cultivated and developed.\n\nWellness includes the following dimensions:\n\nPhysical: The physical dimension recognizes the need for regular physical activity and encourages learning about nutrition while discouraging the use of tobacco, drugs, and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nEmotional: The ability to find support in times of need, express a wide range of emotions, and deal with daily stressors.\n\nSocial: Community building is premised on shared values of respect and dignity, volunteerism, and caring valued as part of the workplace.\n\nFinancial: The ability to plan for the future, be prepared for emergencies, and have access to the information and tools necessary to make good financial decisions.\n\nWorkplace: The ability to pursue interests, values, and purpose in order to gain meaning, happiness, and enrichment professionally.",

        "description": "Your New Wellness Starts Here!!!\n\nOur Mission is to promote the health and wellness of LSU Health Shreveport through education and efforts that encourage habits of wellness, inspire and empower individuals to take responsibility for their own health and support a sense of community in which health and overall well-being are recognized as an essential element of success.\n\nEmotional, social, workplace, and physical well-being are critical to the development and maintenance of competent, caring students, faculty, and healthcare providers. In the current healthcare environment, students, residents, fellows, faculty members, and staff are at increased risk for burnout and depression. Self-care is an important component that impacts the quality of life and work. It is also a skill that must be cultivated and developed.\n\nWellness includes the following dimensions:\n\nPhysical: The physical dimension recognizes the need for regular physical activity and encourages learning about nutrition while discouraging the use of tobacco, drugs, and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nEmotional: The ability to find support in times of need, express a wide range of emotions, and deal with daily stressors.\n\nSocial: Community building is premised on shared values of respect and dignity, volunteerism, and caring valued as part of the workplace.\n\nFinancial: The ability to plan for the future, be prepared for emergencies, and have access to the information and tools necessary to make good financial decisions.\n\nWorkplace: The ability to pursue interests, values, and purpose in order to gain meaning, happiness, and enrichment professionally.",

      "description": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your escape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of escapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription,3-month subscription and  1-year subscription with a 7 day trial, (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy",

        "description": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your escape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of escapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription,3-month subscription and  1-year subscription with a 7 day trial, (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy",

        "description": "How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\n\n\nThere are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n\n\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.\n- Affirmations define your focus.

Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\nTo get access to the I am Premium content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly, and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "description": "Finally Understand What's Going On With Your Body\n\nTrusted by 12 million users who want to reconnect with their bodies and feel better, featured by the App Store in Apps We Love, and collaborating with 25+ universities worldwide — including Harvard Medical School, Arizona State University, and Johns Hopkins — to advance health science.\n\n— Your heart knows everything about you. Welltory helps you listen and understand —\n\nSometimes your body feels like it’s speaking a foreign language. Welltory translates those signals into science-backed insights — whether you’re facing hormonal changes, heart health concerns, fatigue, burnout, or just want to optimize energy and mood.\n\nWe analyze heart rate variability (HRV) — a proven heart health marker backed by 20,000+ studies — to show what your heart and nervous system reveal about your wellness.\n\n— Your Complete Health Story, One App —\n\nYou don’t have to piece together insights from 5 health apps. When you finally have a moment for yourself, everything you need is right there. \n\nConnect 1,000+ devices and apps — Apple Watch, Oura, meditation apps, lab test results, and more — to create your personal health diary. \n\n— Stop Guessing. Start Understanding —\n\nSleep That Actually Restores You\n\nStruggling with insomnia or waking up exhausted? Our Sleep Analysis goes beyond counting hours. Discover what disrupts your rest and get insights to improve recovery. With Echo — a science-based library of calming content tailored to your heartbeat — you’ll fall asleep faster and wake up truly restored.\n\nHeart Health & Blood Pressure Simplified \n\nYour heart reveals what’s really happening in your body. Welltory helps you track blood pressure, hypertension, and other metrics — plus log symptoms in your personal health diary. Share reports with your doctor, or use Welltory as a tracker helping you navigate health, menopause, and aging with confidence.\n\nCan Apple Watch measure blood pressure? No, but Welltory helps you understand your numbers if you sync a monitor or add data manually.\n\nStress That Makes Sense\n\nTurn your Apple Watch into a stress monitor and catch stress before it takes over. No more wondering “why am I so stressed?” — now you’ll know, and know how to respond. See how work, sleep, workouts, and even Zoom meetings affect your stress levels, and recognize when it’s time to pause and restore balance.\n\nActivity Boost Without Pressure\n\nTrack the 60% of activity most fitness apps ignore — we count every effort: walking the dog, house chores, running for the bus, and more. Every activity grows your Mountain in the app — the taller it gets, the more you’ve moved. We also set a Longevity goal that matches where your body is today and gently guides you toward progress, not perfection.\n\nStart listening to your body — and feel the difference with Welltory.\n\nPRICING & TERMS\n\nApp is free to download and use. You can upgrade to Welltory Premium with an auto-renewing subscription.\n\n–– Subscription renews automatically unless turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the period.\n–– Renewal is charged within 24 hours before the current period ends, the cost will be identified. \n–– Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off in the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n–– Free trial portions (if offered) are forfeited after purchase.\n–– Please note that the Family Sharing feature is not applicable for our app.\n— Welltory integrates with Apple Health.\n\nTerms of service:\nhttps://welltory.com/terms/ \n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttps://welltory.com/privacy \n\nTerms of Use (EULA):\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nWe store your data in the cloud, honoring your privacy & safety. contact@welltory.com\n\nNOTE\nWelltory measures heart rate variability and detects heartbeats.

Our new reports help you understand these connections and see how your day truly shapes how you feel.\n\n— Battery Timeline. Watch your energy flow throughout the day. See when it drops, when it grows, and how your choices — rest, sleep, or movement — change the curve. Learn what really charges you and what drains you, one glance at a time.\n\n— Stress Timeline. See when your body is balanced and when it’s overloaded. Over time, you’ll start noticing clear patterns: some tasks wear you out, while others help you unwind. Knowing this, you can plan your day around what truly works for you — so tough moments become easier to handle.\n\n— Stress-Coping Curve. See how stress builds up through the day and how effectively you deal with it. This chart shows when tension starts rising — and when your actions help your body release it. It also brings an important insight: recovery isn’t accidental — it’s the result of specific actions. Knowing when to rest or move helps keep tension from becoming chronic and lets your energy return on time.\n\nStay tuned & rate us if you enjoy using Welltory.",

        "description": "The EufyLife app is dedicated to improving your health. We’ve blended technology and convenience into an easy-to-use app that automatically syncs your health data.\n  \nHOW THE APP WORKS\nA EufyLife account is needed to use this app. You only need to provide an email address and registration takes two steps and only a minute to complete.\n\nTo get started, download EufyLife to your mobile device and register your email address to create an account. \n\nHOW TO PAIR DEVICES\nEufy products are designed to be user friendly. Pairing devices is as simple as enabling Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth on your mobile device, turning on the Eufy product, and following the on-screen instructions to complete pairing. That's it!\n \nHealthKit\nThe EufyLife App will synchronize the records after each weighing (Body Fat Percentage, Body Mass Index, Height, Lean Body Mass, Weight) to Apple Health.\n\nSince the privacy of your health data is very important, EufyLife has an entry point where you can choose to sync your data to Apple Health. No data will be synced to a third party until you choose it.\n\nEufy’s BodySense line of health and wellness-focused products are currently available for use with EufyLife: Smart Scale. \n\nCONNECT WITH US\n• Email: support@eufylife.com\n• Website: eufylife.com\n• Facebook: @EufyOfficial",
