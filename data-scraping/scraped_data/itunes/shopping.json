      "description": "THE SMART, SIMPLE, AND SUSTAINABLE WAY TO SHOP AND SELL.\nPoshmark is the leading marketplace for secondhand style—where real people turn closets into cash and discover deals from over 10,000+ brands across 90+ categories. From fashion to home and everything in between, it’s the easiest way to shop and sell with impact. This future of fashion is here. \n\nSHOP SMARTER\nExplore fresh finds across fashion, beauty, home, pets, and more—up to 70% off retail. Whether you're into vintage gems, everyday staples, or trending brands like SKIMS, Nike, Free People, and Louis Vuitton, Poshmark is where style and savings meet. Shopping sustainable has never felt this seamless or this fun.\n\nSELL IN SECONDS\nGot items you're ready to let go of? Use Smart List AI to list them in just a few taps. It writes your title, fills in the details, and gets your listing ready in seconds—just snap a pic and go. Whether you're cleaning out your closet or going after your next big thing, it’s the easiest way to turn what you’re not wearing into something new.\n\nGIVE STYLE A SECOND LIFE \nOver 350 million items have been recirculated on Poshmark—and every one makes a difference. When you buy or sell secondhand, you're helping reduce fashion waste and supporting a more sustainable way to shop. It’s better for your closet and the planet.\n\nGREAT DEALS, ZERO DOUBT.\nEvery order on Poshmark is protected by Posh Protect, so you can shop stress-free. Secure payments, tracked shipping, and support if anything goes wrong—because getting great deals shouldn’t come with second guesses.\n\nWHERE PEOPLE AND STYLE GO LIVE\nPoshmark isn’t just a marketplace—it’s a community. Follow your favorite closets, shop live with Posh Shows, and join themed Posh Parties happening every day. Whether you’re cleaning out your closet or curating a whole new vibe—there’s space for it all.\nSo go ahead—download the app and start to fashion your dreams.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING\n“One of the best-known and highest-rated apps among online thrifting apps, Poshmark claims the \"best overall\" title because it has the most robust product offerings, generous return program and easiest user experience. You can buy or list pretty much any item of clothing on Poshmark -- it includes sections for women, men, children and pets, along with electronics, home goods, beauty and wellness and, bonus points, a dedicated section for plus sizes going up to 5X.” (CNET)\n\n“Poshmark is getting it right. The site manages to mirror the polished e-commerce experience shoppers have come to expect. It’s easier to list items, information is presented in visually appealing ways and complex search tools make discovery easier.” (Forbes)\n\n“If you’re looking for a bargain but is as equally great for the environment, Poshmark is a second-hand marketplace that sells the trendiest new and used clothing and accessories.” (ELLE Canada)",
