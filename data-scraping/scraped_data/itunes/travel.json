      "description": "Wanderlog is a free travel app (with an optional Pro subscription) for planning every kind of trip, including road trips and group travel: create a trip itinerary, budget costs, organize flight and hotel reservations, view places to visit on a map, and collaborate with friends. With Pro, you can also export your trip to Google Maps and link your Gmail account. After your trip, share a travel guide to inspire other travelers.\n\n- See flights, hotels, and attractions in one place (like TripIt and Tripcase)\n- View plans on a travel map & map your route (like Roadtrippers)\n- Rearrange the order of places easily by drag-and-drop\n- Planning a road trip? Add unlimited stops for free, optimize your route, view times & distances between places, and export places to Google Maps\n- Planning group travel? Invite friends and collaborate in real-time just (like Google Docs)\n- Automatically import reservations by forwarding emails or connecting your Gmail\n- Add things to do from top guides with 1 click (like Tripadvisor and Google Trips/Google Travel)\n- Access your trip plans offline\n- Add notes and links to your stops\n- Have your trip plans automatically sync across devices\n- Set budget, track expenses, and split bills with a group\n\n-------\n\nSEE IT ON A MAP\n\nEvery time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.\n\nSTORE PLANS OFFLINE\n\nAll your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.\n\nGET ON THE ROAD\n\nLooking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS\n\nFor group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary.

Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.\n\nGET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION\n\nFor each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.\n\nCONTROL YOUR SPENDING\n\nSet a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes, and settle debts between tripmates.\n\nTerms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

For a small fee, take the time you need to finalize your plans, or wait for your next paycheck to come in. If the price goes up, you only pay the price you froze it at. But if the price goes down, you just pay the lower price. \n\nTravel with Confidence\nAvoid fees and frustration! Make any trip flexible with Hopper’s Cancel and Change for Any Reason plans. Get instantly rebooked without extra costs if your flight is delayed or you miss a connection with Hopper’s Flight Disruption Guarantee. Travel stress free with 24/7 access to Hopper’s Customer Support. \n\nHelp the Planet, One Booking at a Time. \nWith every booking that occurs on Hopper, we pledge to plant 2 trees to offset the carbon footprint. To date, we’ve planted over 31 million trees. \n\nHopper has no ads, no spam, and no stress — just accurate predictions and travel deals.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

You can choose a prepaid local, regional, or global eSIM plan to get online in 200+ countries and regions worldwide. Simply download an eSIM, install it on your device, and connect to a mobile network when you arrive at your destination!\n\nHow does it work?\n1. Install the Airalo app.\n2.

If you run out of data or your validity period expires, you can top up your eSIM or download a new one right from the Airalo app.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n- eSIMs from Airalo start from US$4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n- Some eSIMs, including our Global Discover+ eSIM, come with a phone number so you can call, text, and access data.

Whether you're dreaming of uncovering hidden gems close to home or exploring iconic destinations across the globe, Around Us is with you every step of the way, offering features to inspire and simplify your journeys.\n\nWhy choose Around Us?\nA living, collaborative guide : Enhanced in real time by an active community of travelers, Around Us offers more than 12 million points of interest in 8 languages. Each location is carefully selected for its relevance and enriched with feedback from users like you.\n\nAn innovative interactive map : With dynamic bubbles, discover local trends at a glance.

Layer as many filters as you like, even using your bookmarks. A color-coded map helps you easily spot your favorite places. With more than 16,000 filters, find exactly what suits you—from hidden national parks with the “Nature Escape” filter to family-friendly activities with the “Family” filter.\n\nA feature you’ll love! Plan your trip from A to Z:\n\nNow you can view and estimate travel times to points of interest or between two points. Take advantage of handy shortcuts to launch searches quickly, even via Siri:\n- Select your stops.\n- Organize your itinerary.\n- Visualize everything on a dynamic map with optimized routes (walking, cycling, or driving).\n- Planning and enjoying your journey has never been easier!\n\nJoin an engaged community\n\nAround Us doesn’t just guide you—it invites you to contribute.
