This app does not support Office 365 personal accounts (for example: name@outlook.com or name@hotmail.com).  If you are not sure about your company’s subscription or the services you have access to, please contact your IT department.\n\nPlanner provides a simple, visual way to organize teamwork. Planner makes it easy for your team to create new plans, organize and assign tasks, share files, chat about what you’re working on, and get updates on progress.\n\n-- Organize work visually --\nEach plan has its own board, where you can organize tasks into buckets. You can categorize tasks based on their status or on whom they’re assigned to. To update the status or change assignments, just drag and drop tasks between columns.\n\n-- Visibility --\nThe My Tasks view provides a comprehensive list of all your tasks and their status across all your plans. When working together on a plan, team members always know who is working on what.\n\n-- Collaborate --\nBuilt for Office 365, Planner lets you work together on the same tasks, attach captured photos directly to them, and even have conversations around tasks without switching between apps. With Planner, all your team’s discussions and deliverables stay with the plan and don’t get locked away across disparate applications.\n\n-- Works across devices --\nPlanner works across all your devices. And with Planner, everyone is always on the same page. Continue conversations and updates tasks while on-the-go or at your desk.\n\nTerms of service: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846830\nPrivacy policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839\n\nTo learn more, please visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=849067\n\nThe Microsoft Planner app will request permission to access your photos and your camera: When you try to attach a photo to a Planner task, the app requests permission to access your Photos app in order to select images.

        "description": "Microsoft Planner requires an eligible Office 365 work or school subscription.  This app does not support Office 365 personal accounts (for example: name@outlook.com or name@hotmail.com).  If you are not sure about your company’s subscription or the services you have access to, please contact your IT department.\n\nPlanner provides a simple, visual way to organize teamwork. Planner makes it easy for your team to create new plans, organize and assign tasks, share files, chat about what you’re working on, and get updates on progress.\n\n-- Organize work visually --\nEach plan has its own board, where you can organize tasks into buckets. You can categorize tasks based on their status or on whom they’re assigned to. To update the status or change assignments, just drag and drop tasks between columns.\n\n-- Visibility --\nThe My Tasks view provides a comprehensive list of all your tasks and their status across all your plans. When working together on a plan, team members always know who is working on what.\n\n-- Collaborate --\nBuilt for Office 365, Planner lets you work together on the same tasks, attach captured photos directly to them, and even have conversations around tasks without switching between apps. With Planner, all your team’s discussions and deliverables stay with the plan and don’t get locked away across disparate applications.\n\n-- Works across devices --\nPlanner works across all your devices. And with Planner, everyone is always on the same page. Continue conversations and updates tasks while on-the-go or at your desk.\n\nTerms of service: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=846830\nPrivacy policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839\n\nTo learn more, please visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=849067\n\nThe Microsoft Planner app will request permission to access your photos and your camera: When you try to attach a photo to a Planner task, the app requests permission to access your Photos app in order to select images.

      "description": "Office FlexiSpace is a system that allows any of your employees to book a workstation in the office by selecting a desk on the map. You can manage office spaces yourself by creating new offices and floors in the built-in constructor (available in the web version of Administration). Make sure your office follows the recommended seating density standards to ensure safe spacing between desks. \n\nMore and more companies are using a hybrid office work model, where employees can alternate between working remotely and in the office. Use Office FlexiSpace workstation booking system to allow your company's employees to find a workstation in advance to come into the office. Take full advantage of the hybrid office, letting your employees find a place for teamwork or a secluded spot to focus on their tasks. \n\nControl the number of people in the office at any one time and limit the density of workstations to keep employees at a safe distance from each other. Get a daily report of which workstations were in use today to organize efficient cleaning. Use the Heatmap report (available in the web version of Administration) to identify gathering places in the office and use this information to further develop your office space. \n\nThe system also includes an office checkout confirmation feature, so you can make sure employees aren't just booking workstations, but actually use them at their chosen times. Generate unique QR codes for each desk and place them at workstations, so that employees can only confirm bookings when they are in the office. Unconfirmed reservations are automatically canceled, so you'll be sure that workstations aren’t in use. \n\nSearching on the office map will give you the opportunity to orient yourself faster and introduce newcomers to the additional benefits of your office. \n\nDo you use Microsoft Teams corporate messenger? Connect a chatbot to receive notifications about upcoming arrivals or to use it to manage workplace reservations.",

        "description": "Office FlexiSpace is a system that allows any of your employees to book a workstation in the office by selecting a desk on the map. You can manage office spaces yourself by creating new offices and floors in the built-in constructor (available in the web version of Administration). Make sure your office follows the recommended seating density standards to ensure safe spacing between desks. \n\nMore and more companies are using a hybrid office work model, where employees can alternate between working remotely and in the office. Use Office FlexiSpace workstation booking system to allow your company's employees to find a workstation in advance to come into the office. Take full advantage of the hybrid office, letting your employees find a place for teamwork or a secluded spot to focus on their tasks. \n\nControl the number of people in the office at any one time and limit the density of workstations to keep employees at a safe distance from each other. Get a daily report of which workstations were in use today to organize efficient cleaning. Use the Heatmap report (available in the web version of Administration) to identify gathering places in the office and use this information to further develop your office space. \n\nThe system also includes an office checkout confirmation feature, so you can make sure employees aren't just booking workstations, but actually use them at their chosen times. Generate unique QR codes for each desk and place them at workstations, so that employees can only confirm bookings when they are in the office. Unconfirmed reservations are automatically canceled, so you'll be sure that workstations aren’t in use. \n\nSearching on the office map will give you the opportunity to orient yourself faster and introduce newcomers to the additional benefits of your office. \n\nDo you use Microsoft Teams corporate messenger? Connect a chatbot to receive notifications about upcoming arrivals or to use it to manage workplace reservations.",

      "description": "The Divine Office App is an opportunity for you to participate in the recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours, an ancient and meditative collection of psalms, hymns and scripture that represent the public prayer of the Christian community.\nIf you are unable to pray in community, but love the contentment of praying with others, a praised feature of the Divine Office App lets you view locations where other Christians around the world are simultaneously praying with you.\n\nThis version is the official prayer book of the Catholic Church, however, it is suitable for all Christian faith traditions. It contains the official text and audio of daily prayers from the Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Catholic Church (Breviary) and has been approved for use in the United States by USCCB.\n\nThe Divine Office App is designed to make praying more convenient, enjoyable, and simple enough for anyone to use. It automatically downloads the appropriate prayers for each office, every day of the year, including Solemnities, Feasts, and Memorials.\n\nWhen St. Paul advises us in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 to “pray without ceasing,” he intends more than simply bowing our heads and speaking to God on a regular basis. He means for us to adopt an ongoing attitude of prayer that is a way of life and a constant intercession for the salvation of all mankind.\n\nAs the mystical body of Christ prays in unison, it fulfills what Paul advises as Christian conduct, that believers at once pray for the good of themselves, their neighbors, and the world. In this way, prayers become liturgy, a way to fulfill our divine calling and a practical approach for addressing the suffering of the world.",

        "description": "The Divine Office App is an opportunity for you to participate in the recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours, an ancient and meditative collection of psalms, hymns and scripture that represent the public prayer of the Christian community.\nIf you are unable to pray in community, but love the contentment of praying with others, a praised feature of the Divine Office App lets you view locations where other Christians around the world are simultaneously praying with you.\n\nThis version is the official prayer book of the Catholic Church, however, it is suitable for all Christian faith traditions. It contains the official text and audio of daily prayers from the Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Catholic Church (Breviary) and has been approved for use in the United States by USCCB.\n\nThe Divine Office App is designed to make praying more convenient, enjoyable, and simple enough for anyone to use. It automatically downloads the appropriate prayers for each office, every day of the year, including Solemnities, Feasts, and Memorials.\n\nWhen St. Paul advises us in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 to “pray without ceasing,” he intends more than simply bowing our heads and speaking to God on a regular basis. He means for us to adopt an ongoing attitude of prayer that is a way of life and a constant intercession for the salvation of all mankind.\n\nAs the mystical body of Christ prays in unison, it fulfills what Paul advises as Christian conduct, that believers at once pray for the good of themselves, their neighbors, and the world. In this way, prayers become liturgy, a way to fulfill our divine calling and a practical approach for addressing the suffering of the world.",

      "description": "Want to run your business from your smartphone? Whether you’re on the go, in the office, or working remotely, the UniTel Voice Office App allows you to manage your business conversations from anywhere. Use the app to make audio and video calls, instant message your team members, and see who’s available or who’s busy — all from the palm of your hand. \n\n\n\nTo use this app you must be a UniTel Voice customer who has signed up for the Office plan. \n\n\n\nFAQs:\n\n\n\n1. How do I log in to this app?\n\nTo log in to this app you need to first create your own employee extension and then click “request device setup” to receive login credentials. \n\n\nNote: This app is designed to sync with your personal employee extension. So for that reason, the admin-level username and password you created at signup will not work as your app login.\n\n\n\n2. How do I ensure high call quality using this app?\n\nFor the best experience, we recommend using a strong wifi connection. This mobile app uses your local wifi to make and receive calls. If wifi isn’t available this app will run off your cellular data. But like all VoIP technologies, if you have a weak wifi connection or a poor data signal, it can affect your call quality.\n\n\n\n3. Is the app free?\n\nThis app is free to UniTel Voice Office customers as part of their business phone system. \n\n\n\n4. Do I have to use the app?\n\nNo. The UniTel Voice Office plan allows you to also connect IP-phones (physical desk phones) and softphones (computer-based phones) so business conversations can flow across your desktop and mobile devices. \n\n\n\n5. Can everyone on my team use this app?\n\nYes, every person who has their own employee extension can access and use the app to manage their business calls and messages. \n\nWith UniTel Voice, phone system \"users\" and employee extensions are one-in-the-same.",

        "description": "Want to run your business from your smartphone? Whether you’re on the go, in the office, or working remotely, the UniTel Voice Office App allows you to manage your business conversations from anywhere. Use the app to make audio and video calls, instant message your team members, and see who’s available or who’s busy — all from the palm of your hand. \n\n\n\nTo use this app you must be a UniTel Voice customer who has signed up for the Office plan. \n\n\n\nFAQs:\n\n\n\n1. How do I log in to this app?\n\nTo log in to this app you need to first create your own employee extension and then click “request device setup” to receive login credentials. \n\n\nNote: This app is designed to sync with your personal employee extension. So for that reason, the admin-level username and password you created at signup will not work as your app login.\n\n\n\n2. How do I ensure high call quality using this app?\n\nFor the best experience, we recommend using a strong wifi connection. This mobile app uses your local wifi to make and receive calls. If wifi isn’t available this app will run off your cellular data. But like all VoIP technologies, if you have a weak wifi connection or a poor data signal, it can affect your call quality.\n\n\n\n3. Is the app free?\n\nThis app is free to UniTel Voice Office customers as part of their business phone system. \n\n\n\n4. Do I have to use the app?\n\nNo. The UniTel Voice Office plan allows you to also connect IP-phones (physical desk phones) and softphones (computer-based phones) so business conversations can flow across your desktop and mobile devices. \n\n\n\n5. Can everyone on my team use this app?\n\nYes, every person who has their own employee extension can access and use the app to manage their business calls and messages. \n\nWith UniTel Voice, phone system \"users\" and employee extensions are one-in-the-same.",
