      "description": "The “Little Stories” app is a collection of stories in which your child plays the main character. It's easy – enter your child’s name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading stories about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make things even better, we've added beautiful soundtracks and detailed illustrations to accompany each story and help you raise your child in a positive environment. You can also make your own audiobooks! Take a few minutes to record yourself and your child will be able to listen to a charming audiobook in your voice!\n\nIf you like fairy tales, bedtime stories, or children’s books, then “Little Stories” is a great option for you! Let love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 3500+ illustrations\n• Illustrations will match your child’s gender\n• 70+ exciting stories, and many more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanying each story\n• Create audiobooks by recording your voice!\n\nWe’d like to tell you a bit more about the process we use to create stories for your kids so that you have a better idea of the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) We search for an author. Regardless of the writer’s nationality or language, we look for unique and captivating stories. Our main condition is that each bedtime story contains at most 50 scenes and is educational.\n\n2) We create the storyboard. It consists of rough sketches that serve as the template for the finalized drawings in the storybook, helping us decide how it will look.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved by our team, we search for an illustrator. We take great pride in matching each artist with a story that suits their style. Personal touches make our bedtime stories for kids come to life!\n\n4) At the same time, our composer begins creating the soundtrack for the story. Inspired by the theme of the tale, he designs a gentle melody that will transport your child to relaxation and sleep (maybe you too).\n\n5) After the story is finished, we translate it so that the children of the world can enjoy it in their language.\n\n6) The story is then published in our library of books for kids.\n\nThe entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. We take great care to provide an amazing experience.\n\nWe are always adding new children's stories to our collection! \nStories are suited for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on Instagram @diveomedia",

        "description": "The “Little Stories” app is a collection of stories in which your child plays the main character. It's easy – enter your child’s name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading stories about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make things even better, we've added beautiful soundtracks and detailed illustrations to accompany each story and help you raise your child in a positive environment. You can also make your own audiobooks! Take a few minutes to record yourself and your child will be able to listen to a charming audiobook in your voice!\n\nIf you like fairy tales, bedtime stories, or children’s books, then “Little Stories” is a great option for you! Let love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 3500+ illustrations\n• Illustrations will match your child’s gender\n• 70+ exciting stories, and many more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanying each story\n• Create audiobooks by recording your voice!\n\nWe’d like to tell you a bit more about the process we use to create stories for your kids so that you have a better idea of the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) We search for an author. Regardless of the writer’s nationality or language, we look for unique and captivating stories. Our main condition is that each bedtime story contains at most 50 scenes and is educational.\n\n2) We create the storyboard. It consists of rough sketches that serve as the template for the finalized drawings in the storybook, helping us decide how it will look.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved by our team, we search for an illustrator. We take great pride in matching each artist with a story that suits their style. Personal touches make our bedtime stories for kids come to life!\n\n4) At the same time, our composer begins creating the soundtrack for the story. Inspired by the theme of the tale, he designs a gentle melody that will transport your child to relaxation and sleep (maybe you too).\n\n5) After the story is finished, we translate it so that the children of the world can enjoy it in their language.\n\n6) The story is then published in our library of books for kids.\n\nThe entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. We take great care to provide an amazing experience.\n\nWe are always adding new children's stories to our collection! \nStories are suited for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on Instagram @diveomedia",

      "description": "inDrive, formerly known as inDriver, is a revolutionary ride-share application that boasts a presence in over 888 cities across 48 countries. Best of all, it’s completely free to use!\n\nWe're a new kind of rideshare app. We started up from scratch in 2013, and since then we've grown like crazy all around the world.\nAnd now we're bringing our game-changing rides to the USA!\n\nIt’s an excellent taxi alternative for your trip. You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. \n\nMORE CONTROL\nSet the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you\n\nFAIR PRICES\nOur rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees\n\nSAFETY FIRST\nVetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team\n\nAs a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take.\n\nWhy Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app)\n\nLOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS\n\nWe keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch.\nWe think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. \n\nQUICK AND EASY\n\nRequesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started.\n\nOFFER YOUR PRICE\n\nWe understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. \n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\n\nWith inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps.\n\nSTAY SAFE\n\nBefore accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers.\n\nADD EXTRA OPTIONS\n\nBy using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request.\n\nJOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\n\nIf you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative.\n\nWhether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative. Install inDrive (inDriver) to ride & drive on your terms!",

        "description": "inDrive, formerly known as inDriver, is a revolutionary ride-share application that boasts a presence in over 888 cities across 48 countries. Best of all, it’s completely free to use!\n\nWe're a new kind of rideshare app. We started up from scratch in 2013, and since then we've grown like crazy all around the world.\nAnd now we're bringing our game-changing rides to the USA!\n\nIt’s an excellent taxi alternative for your trip. You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. \n\nMORE CONTROL\nSet the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you\n\nFAIR PRICES\nOur rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees\n\nSAFETY FIRST\nVetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team\n\nAs a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take.\n\nWhy Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app)\n\nLOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS\n\nWe keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch.\nWe think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. \n\nQUICK AND EASY\n\nRequesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started.\n\nOFFER YOUR PRICE\n\nWe understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. \n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\n\nWith inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps.\n\nSTAY SAFE\n\nBefore accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers.\n\nADD EXTRA OPTIONS\n\nBy using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request.\n\nJOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\n\nIf you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative.\n\nWhether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative. Install inDrive (inDriver) to ride & drive on your terms!",

      "description": "We have enhanced our digital editions (where possible) to bring the content to life by embedding animations, video and interactive tools to help illustrate the key points and skills from our popular books. Download this free app to browse the eBook editions – you can also try free taster versions of many eBooks, so you can try before you buy.\n\nThese eBooks are a great resource supporting our world famous RYA Training Courses such as those within the trademark RYA Yachtmaster Scheme, the RYA Powerboat Scheme and the RYA Dinghy Sailing & Windsurfing Schemes among others. You will find eBooks of essential and recommended titles along with plenty of further reading and development, whether you’re starting to sail by taking a Competent Crew course, taking things further with a Day Skipper course or taking your RYA Yachtmaster exam – whatever you need, we’ve got it covered!\n\nThere are great examples throughout our range of our use of interactive content in areas such as seamanship, boat handling, passage planning, knots and stability but you’ll find something very special in our editions for:\n• Collision Regulations – where we've developed over twenty interactive 360° lights and shapes tool to provide readers a more realistic way of viewing how vessels will actually present themselves in a wide variety of contexts, at four different times of day covering both day and night.\n• VHF – where we’ve created animated examples of the voice procedures in the RYA VHF Handbook and also linked the content to sample questions to help students pass the RYA SRC exam.\n• Navigation – where we’ve developed a special tool to replicate using the tidal curves in the RYA Training Almanacs to help students taking shorebased navigation courses.\n\nAlthough these eBooks are designed for tablets, we’re still keeping smart phones very much in mind. This way, you’ll still be able to access the enhanced interactive content on the smaller devices even if you feel you wouldn't read a book on something so small.\n\nThere’s plenty for instructors as well with not only the interactive content, that can be used as demonstrations and enhanced learning on and off the water. There are also a whole host of useful features, (which we’re always evolving) such as bookmarking, note taking and inter-edition linking that will help you manage the content you want to support the way you teach.\n\nThis updated version of the app now includes a wider range of boating categories to make it easier for you to navigate all the new content that we are regularly adding:\n• Sail\n• Dinghy\n• Sail Racing\n• Sail Cruising\n• Windsurfing\n• Power\n• Powerboating\n• Motor Cruising\n• Personal Watercraft\n• Inland Waterways",

        "description": "We have enhanced our digital editions (where possible) to bring the content to life by embedding animations, video and interactive tools to help illustrate the key points and skills from our popular books. Download this free app to browse the eBook editions – you can also try free taster versions of many eBooks, so you can try before you buy.\n\nThese eBooks are a great resource supporting our world famous RYA Training Courses such as those within the trademark RYA Yachtmaster Scheme, the RYA Powerboat Scheme and the RYA Dinghy Sailing & Windsurfing Schemes among others. You will find eBooks of essential and recommended titles along with plenty of further reading and development, whether you’re starting to sail by taking a Competent Crew course, taking things further with a Day Skipper course or taking your RYA Yachtmaster exam – whatever you need, we’ve got it covered!\n\nThere are great examples throughout our range of our use of interactive content in areas such as seamanship, boat handling, passage planning, knots and stability but you’ll find something very special in our editions for:\n• Collision Regulations – where we've developed over twenty interactive 360° lights and shapes tool to provide readers a more realistic way of viewing how vessels will actually present themselves in a wide variety of contexts, at four different times of day covering both day and night.\n• VHF – where we’ve created animated examples of the voice procedures in the RYA VHF Handbook and also linked the content to sample questions to help students pass the RYA SRC exam.\n• Navigation – where we’ve developed a special tool to replicate using the tidal curves in the RYA Training Almanacs to help students taking shorebased navigation courses.\n\nAlthough these eBooks are designed for tablets, we’re still keeping smart phones very much in mind. This way, you’ll still be able to access the enhanced interactive content on the smaller devices even if you feel you wouldn't read a book on something so small.\n\nThere’s plenty for instructors as well with not only the interactive content, that can be used as demonstrations and enhanced learning on and off the water. There are also a whole host of useful features, (which we’re always evolving) such as bookmarking, note taking and inter-edition linking that will help you manage the content you want to support the way you teach.\n\nThis updated version of the app now includes a wider range of boating categories to make it easier for you to navigate all the new content that we are regularly adding:\n• Sail\n• Dinghy\n• Sail Racing\n• Sail Cruising\n• Windsurfing\n• Power\n• Powerboating\n• Motor Cruising\n• Personal Watercraft\n• Inland Waterways",

      "description": "TheFork is Europe’s leading restaurant booking platform, proudly bringing people together through unique and affordable culinary experiences since 2007. What are you waiting for? Activate your location and we’ll activate your taste buds! You set the tone, we set the table.\n\nTheFork continues to be savoured across the biggest foodie hotspots in France, Spain, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden and Australia. But wait, what exactly do we bring to the table? Here are 6 reasons to download TheFork app right now.\n\n1. Things that tickle our taste buds: fast, free and easy online booking\nWe know that normal life means having a lot on your plate, so to make things a bit easier for you, we've simplified restaurant booking. With a few simple taps on our mobile app, you’ll be one step closer to having that ‘mmm’ moment of pure belly satisfaction, in the most seamless way possible.\n\n2. Frugal on prices, never on flavours\nOur amazing restaurant partners love their diners as much as we love ours and offer exclusive discounts on reservations throughout the year (automatically applied and subject to conditions at the time of booking). That way restaurants get to open their doors to all types of diners, making dining out accessible to everyone.\n\n3. Community insights = better bites\nTuck into the wisdom of our gourmet community! With over 20 million trusted reviews from only customers who have actually tried the restaurant—your palette is in good hands!\n\n4. We don’t skimp on choice\nReserved? Not us. That’s just a label for a table. So whether you’re looking for the perfect spot for bottomless brunching, taco crunching or al-fresco munching, our foodies are spoiled for choice with our diverse collection of over 60,000 restaurants and 40,000 photos, menus and community reviews that will satisfy just about any culinary mood and occasion. After all, variety is the spice of life! Browse, scroll and add to favourites, so you can find more of what you love. Now that’s food for thought.\n\n5. INSIDER: sit back and relax while we level up your dining-out game.\nOur foodie experts are always hard at work to stay on top of our INSIDER collection featuring the best restaurants. With our feed of critically acclaimed insights and selections, no chances are taken on promoting the dining out spots that are turning heads for the best ambiance, ratings, service and food.\n\n6. We take loyalty VERY seriously. \nTo reward our awesome foodie community, every booking with TheFork accumulates unique Yums points, which can be redeemed in the form of a tasty discount at one of our many partner restaurants down the line. Here’s how it works:\n\n1 reservation = 100 Yums (Y)\n\nOnce you've accumulated enough you can enjoy amazing offers which converts to: \n1,000 Y = €10 / CHF15 / AUD$20 / £20 loyalty discount!\n2,000 Y = €25 / CHF35 / AUD$50 / £50 loyalty discount!\n\nKeep an eye out for double Yums and other ways to earn more Yums as you book.\n\nWe love hearing from our TheFork foodie community!

        "description": "TheFork is Europe’s leading restaurant booking platform, proudly bringing people together through unique and affordable culinary experiences since 2007. What are you waiting for? Activate your location and we’ll activate your taste buds! You set the tone, we set the table.\n\nTheFork continues to be savoured across the biggest foodie hotspots in France, Spain, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden and Australia. But wait, what exactly do we bring to the table? Here are 6 reasons to download TheFork app right now.\n\n1. Things that tickle our taste buds: fast, free and easy online booking\nWe know that normal life means having a lot on your plate, so to make things a bit easier for you, we've simplified restaurant booking. With a few simple taps on our mobile app, you’ll be one step closer to having that ‘mmm’ moment of pure belly satisfaction, in the most seamless way possible.\n\n2. Frugal on prices, never on flavours\nOur amazing restaurant partners love their diners as much as we love ours and offer exclusive discounts on reservations throughout the year (automatically applied and subject to conditions at the time of booking). That way restaurants get to open their doors to all types of diners, making dining out accessible to everyone.\n\n3. Community insights = better bites\nTuck into the wisdom of our gourmet community! With over 20 million trusted reviews from only customers who have actually tried the restaurant—your palette is in good hands!\n\n4. We don’t skimp on choice\nReserved? Not us. That’s just a label for a table. So whether you’re looking for the perfect spot for bottomless brunching, taco crunching or al-fresco munching, our foodies are spoiled for choice with our diverse collection of over 60,000 restaurants and 40,000 photos, menus and community reviews that will satisfy just about any culinary mood and occasion. After all, variety is the spice of life! Browse, scroll and add to favourites, so you can find more of what you love. Now that’s food for thought.\n\n5. INSIDER: sit back and relax while we level up your dining-out game.\nOur foodie experts are always hard at work to stay on top of our INSIDER collection featuring the best restaurants. With our feed of critically acclaimed insights and selections, no chances are taken on promoting the dining out spots that are turning heads for the best ambiance, ratings, service and food.\n\n6. We take loyalty VERY seriously. \nTo reward our awesome foodie community, every booking with TheFork accumulates unique Yums points, which can be redeemed in the form of a tasty discount at one of our many partner restaurants down the line. Here’s how it works:\n\n1 reservation = 100 Yums (Y)\n\nOnce you've accumulated enough you can enjoy amazing offers which converts to: \n1,000 Y = €10 / CHF15 / AUD$20 / £20 loyalty discount!\n2,000 Y = €25 / CHF35 / AUD$50 / £50 loyalty discount!\n\nKeep an eye out for double Yums and other ways to earn more Yums as you book.\n\nWe love hearing from our TheFork foodie community! Reach out at contact@thefork.com.\n\n>In the UK, follow us on:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFork.uk/\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thefork_uk/?hl=en",
