(Yeah, we said the thing…)\n\n\nOur creators march to the beat of their own drum, as do we, disrupting our opps with a 95-5 subscription split, our creator incentive program, and the freedom to multistream.\n\n\nThat’s why the likes of xQc, Amouranth, and MaxHolloway all pick Kick.\n\n\nFor viewers, it’s the fear of missing out that compels them to tune in, the chance to be part of internet culture, all in real-time and ad-free.\n\n\nbut lets be real, no one reads these, so if youve made it this far, at least give the app 5 stars. it will good for my performance review. thanks :)\n\n\nP.S.

(Yeah, we said the thing…)\n\n\nOur creators march to the beat of their own drum, as do we, disrupting our opps with a 95-5 subscription split, our creator incentive program, and the freedom to multistream.\n\n\nThat’s why the likes of xQc, Amouranth, and MaxHolloway all pick Kick.\n\n\nFor viewers, it’s the fear of missing out that compels them to tune in, the chance to be part of internet culture, all in real-time and ad-free.\n\n\nbut lets be real, no one reads these, so if youve made it this far, at least give the app 5 stars. it will good for my performance review. thanks :)\n\n\nP.S.

Winner *Best Entertainment App*  Chip.de.\n\nYou can watch anything from your movie collection. No need for complex conversion processes. No need to manually transfer programs to your device.\n\n“Can these guys do no wrong? Seriously, if only other app devs knew how to make apps as well as these guys, the world would be a better place. Or at least my device would be less buggy. I was just watching a Full HD copy of Avatar Extended Edition being streamed from my PC on my iPod Touch 2nd Generation and it looked and played amazingly.” \n- UK Reviewer \n\n“…it's as good as having the original VLC player on your iOS device…” \n- CallingAllGeeks.org\n\n“…Setup is a snap and literally takes 2 seconds. You can browse through all your movies from your device and click any one to start playing. It even works if you have the movies stored on a USB drive connected to the host computer.”  \n-The Times of India\n\n“Took me seconds to setup to stream from a secondary drive in my home office. Going straight out to get a cable for my TV.” \n- USA Reviewer \n\n“….This sucker can stream off the pc and plays virtually anything you throw at it. Download it now!” \n- TaxiDriver at Blippy.com \n\n\nThere are a huge number of movie formats, and VLC can convert most of them - but it can't convert everything.

        "description": "Sit anywhere in your house and watch movies or TV shows on your iPhone, iPod or iPad. \nVLC Streamer streams movies from your computer to your iDevice. Winner *Best Entertainment App*  Chip.de.\n\nYou can watch anything from your movie collection. No need for complex conversion processes. No need to manually transfer programs to your device.\n\n“Can these guys do no wrong? Seriously, if only other app devs knew how to make apps as well as these guys, the world would be a better place. Or at least my device would be less buggy. I was just watching a Full HD copy of Avatar Extended Edition being streamed from my PC on my iPod Touch 2nd Generation and it looked and played amazingly.” \n- UK Reviewer \n\n“…it's as good as having the original VLC player on your iOS device…” \n- CallingAllGeeks.org\n\n“…Setup is a snap and literally takes 2 seconds. You can browse through all your movies from your device and click any one to start playing. It even works if you have the movies stored on a USB drive connected to the host computer.”  \n-The Times of India\n\n“Took me seconds to setup to stream from a secondary drive in my home office. Going straight out to get a cable for my TV.” \n- USA Reviewer \n\n“….This sucker can stream off the pc and plays virtually anything you throw at it. Download it now!” \n- TaxiDriver at Blippy.com \n\n\nThere are a huge number of movie formats, and VLC can convert most of them - but it can't convert everything. If you have any doubts, then please try the free version of this application first. \n\n• Features include • \n\n- Free helper app gets you streaming quickly and allows you to browse local drives, and Windows network shares \n- Stream over wifi directly from your computer\n- Support for multiple resolutions and streaming quality levels \n- Customisable gesture controls\n- Live streaming of video after a few seconds of processing \n(assumes a reasonably powered computer) \n- Airplay support \n- TV Out support for iPad and iPhone4 \n- Easy to copy movies directly to your device for watching on the plane or out of the house.\n- Supports Windows, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8\n- Supports Mac OS 10.5 and above  \n\n•  System Requirements • \n\n- VLC Streamer will not play DRM protected videos. Videos from the iTunes store do include DRM. \n- VLC Streamer is designed to work on your local network, and the free helper app has to run on your Mac or PC. \n-  Supports Windows, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10.\n-  Supports Mac OS 10.7 Intel and above.\n\n• Response to feedback • \n\n-If you do have any problems streaming movies, then please just check the help instructions in the app. Feel free to drop me an email (my personal mail is in the app) if you need help. \n\nEnjoy!",

Record and download videos from Netflix before they go offline then watch them anywhere, anytime, even after they have been removed from Netflix. No need to select only the videos that Netflix lets you download, with PlayOn Cloud you can download ANY Netflix or Hulu video. Record and download Disney+ videos to watch offline. The simple PlayOn Cloud app gives you easy access to download all streaming videos from Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, The CW, Discovery+, Showtime, STARZ, Vudu, Pluto, Tubi, CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, PBS, The Roku Channel, and BBC iPlayer, Acorn, Xfinity, and Spectrum.– over 20 of the most popular streaming services. Love House of Dragon, Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or want to watch Moon Knight when you’re offline? Simply select the show you want and hit record. Once recorded, a streaming show or movie will be available for you to download to your mobile device or PC. You can even set it to automatically download to your phone, tablet, or TV as soon as the recording is finished. You can skip right over the recordings automatically when you watch. You can even watch your recordings on your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV (and skip the recordings). The recording happens in the PlayOn Cloud so no data is used to make the recording.\n\nOnce your PlayOn Cloud recording is downloaded, you can watch it anytime and anywhere. You can watch it on your big screen TV with your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV. No more worrying about a Netflix video leaving. You can even download it to your Mac, PC or other device. No more WiFi requirement to watch on your mobile device – you can download Netflix and watch when you're not on WiFi without using data. Want to watch your downloaded PlayOn Cloud recordings on your TV? You can cast to your TV with Roku, Chromecast or Fire TV or AirPlay it to your Apple TV. Have a long flight tomorrow? Queue up Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or The Mandalorian tonight and they’ll be downloaded and waiting when you take off. Long subway ride to work? With PlayOn Cloud, you’ll be watching downloaded Netflix, The CW, or Disney+ videos the entire time. Need a selection of safe shows for your kids to watch? PlayOn Cloud makes it easy to fill up your kid's device with safe streaming shows - and watch them without using any cellular data, or watching any commercials. When you watch recordings that have commercials, you have an option to automatically skip the ads. How great is that?\n\nWant to make PlayOn Cloud even more powerful? Get an optional PlayOn Cloud Storage and Credit plan.\n\nYou'll get a week to make 7 free recordings. After that you'll be billed $4.99 per month for 30 recordings and 100GB cloud storage.

Love House of Dragon, Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or want to watch Moon Knight when you’re offline? Simply select the show you want and hit record. Once recorded, a streaming show or movie will be available for you to download to your mobile device or PC. You can even set it to automatically download to your phone, tablet, or TV as soon as the recording is finished. You can skip right over the recordings automatically when you watch. You can even watch your recordings on your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV (and skip the recordings).

You can watch it on your big screen TV with your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV. No more worrying about a Netflix video leaving. You can even download it to your Mac, PC or other device.

Want to watch your downloaded PlayOn Cloud recordings on your TV? You can cast to your TV with Roku, Chromecast or Fire TV or AirPlay it to your Apple TV. Have a long flight tomorrow? Queue up Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or The Mandalorian tonight and they’ll be downloaded and waiting when you take off. Long subway ride to work? With PlayOn Cloud, you’ll be watching downloaded Netflix, The CW, or Disney+ videos the entire time. Need a selection of safe shows for your kids to watch? PlayOn Cloud makes it easy to fill up your kid's device with safe streaming shows - and watch them without using any cellular data, or watching any commercials. When you watch recordings that have commercials, you have an option to automatically skip the ads. How great is that?\n\nWant to make PlayOn Cloud even more powerful? Get an optional PlayOn Cloud Storage and Credit plan.\n\nYou'll get a week to make 7 free recordings. After that you'll be billed $4.99 per month for 30 recordings and 100GB cloud storage. You’ll be charged as a recurring transaction through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.playon.tv/eula\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.playon.tv/privacy",

        "description": "LimeStreamer makes live audio streaming simple.  Use the LimeStreamer app to receive any live internet audio that’s available on the LimeStreamer network and listen directly on your iPhone or iPad.  Listen anywhere… at home, on the go or in the car and from anywhere in the world!\n\nFinding the audio stream you want is easy.  Just enter the Stream ID and listen.  You can try it out by connecting to our demo stream which is on 123 123 123.\n\nAnd getting your live audio onto the LimeStreamer network is just as simple.  You DON’T need an expensive streaming provider, a streaming server or heaps of technical know-how.  You just get the LimeStreamer Encoder unit from us, plug in your audio and boom -  you’re online!\n\nIt’s the highest quality streaming audio.  It’s genuinely LIVE (very low delay… so unlike normal streaming audio), low-cost and simple both to setup and to listen.\n\nMake your audio available to anyone, put your Stream ID on your website if you wish… or just allow your own group of users or members to listen by keeping your Stream ID private.  You can even password-protect your stream if you wish and we’ll encrypt your stream for you.\n\nLimeStreamer is both cost effective and simple to install... if you'd like to find out more, visit us online:  www.LimeStreamer.com",

      "description": "Watch web-videos, online-movies, livestreams and live-tv shows and your personal photos, videos & music by using Google Cast on your Sony TV, Vizio SmartCast TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Toshiba TV, Chromecast, Nexus Player or Nvidia Shield gaming console. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Google Cast enabled device (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, like Vizio TV, Toshiba TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Chromecast, Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield gaming console\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings.\n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks.",

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, like Vizio TV, Toshiba TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Chromecast, Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield gaming console\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings.\n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks.",

      "description": "Upflix is a guide that helps you discover where your favorite movies and shows are available on the streaming platforms you already subscribe to.\n\nUpflix is great tool for keeping up with releases and discovering where to watch your favorite content on the largest streaming platforms.\n\nYour ultimate guide to movies and series on the major streaming services. If you're a subscriber to Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, Max, Hulu, or AppleTV, Upflix is perfect for you!\n\nWith such a massive combined catalog (Netflix alone has 5000 titles), it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Upflix offers a solution that will impress you and help you navigate more efficiently.\n  \n- Be the first to know:\nYou'll receive notifications about content added to the platforms. If Netflix adds a new episode of the series you're watching, you'll know. If Prime Video adds a new movie to its catalog, you'll know that too. Upflix will keep you informed firsthand about the latest movies and series. Did you know that Netflix now has \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\"?\n\n- User-friendly Guide:\nUpflix is a practical and simple guide. Everything is quick and straightforward, with no accounts or logins required. Just download and start using it. The only prerequisite is being a subscriber to Netflix or another streaming service that we support.\n\n- Expert Reviews:\nWith Upflix, you'll have access to reviews and ratings from specialized websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB, which will help you decide what to watch. If Netflix just released a series and you're not sure if it's good, just check Upflix!\n\n- Custom Lists:\nUpflix offers two different types of lists: a wishlist and a list of the series you're following. If you're watching \"The Witcher\" on Netflix and \"The Last of Us\" on Max, you can add both series and be notified whenever a new episode or season arrives. That way, you won't miss a thing.\n\n- Discover where to watch:\nNot sure on which platform your favorite movie or series is available? Our tool allows you to save time and find where to watch your favorite content. Did you know that \"Lord of The Rings\" is available on Netflix, Hulu, and Max? And that HBO's \"Ballers\" is on Netflix? Oh, did you hear that Netflix removed \"My Neighbor Totoro\"? \nThe Roulette is a premium feature and requires a subscription to be used.\n\nThe supported platforms are: Netflix, Max, Disney, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, AppleTV+, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll.\n\nAll film-related metadata used in Upflix, including actor, director and studio names, synopses, release dates, trailers and poster art is supplied by The Movie Database (TMDB).\nUpflix uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.\n\nTerms of Use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

        "description": "Upflix is a guide that helps you discover where your favorite movies and shows are available on the streaming platforms you already subscribe to.\n\nUpflix is great tool for keeping up with releases and discovering where to watch your favorite content on the largest streaming platforms.\n\nYour ultimate guide to movies and series on the major streaming services. If you're a subscriber to Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, Max, Hulu, or AppleTV, Upflix is perfect for you!\n\nWith such a massive combined catalog (Netflix alone has 5000 titles), it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Upflix offers a solution that will impress you and help you navigate more efficiently.\n  \n- Be the first to know:\nYou'll receive notifications about content added to the platforms. If Netflix adds a new episode of the series you're watching, you'll know. If Prime Video adds a new movie to its catalog, you'll know that too. Upflix will keep you informed firsthand about the latest movies and series. Did you know that Netflix now has \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\"?\n\n- User-friendly Guide:\nUpflix is a practical and simple guide. Everything is quick and straightforward, with no accounts or logins required. Just download and start using it. The only prerequisite is being a subscriber to Netflix or another streaming service that we support.\n\n- Expert Reviews:\nWith Upflix, you'll have access to reviews and ratings from specialized websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB, which will help you decide what to watch. If Netflix just released a series and you're not sure if it's good, just check Upflix!\n\n- Custom Lists:\nUpflix offers two different types of lists: a wishlist and a list of the series you're following. If you're watching \"The Witcher\" on Netflix and \"The Last of Us\" on Max, you can add both series and be notified whenever a new episode or season arrives. That way, you won't miss a thing.\n\n- Discover where to watch:\nNot sure on which platform your favorite movie or series is available? Our tool allows you to save time and find where to watch your favorite content. Did you know that \"Lord of The Rings\" is available on Netflix, Hulu, and Max? And that HBO's \"Ballers\" is on Netflix? Oh, did you hear that Netflix removed \"My Neighbor Totoro\"? \nThe Roulette is a premium feature and requires a subscription to be used.\n\nThe supported platforms are: Netflix, Max, Disney, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, AppleTV+, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll.\n\nAll film-related metadata used in Upflix, including actor, director and studio names, synopses, release dates, trailers and poster art is supplied by The Movie Database (TMDB).\nUpflix uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.\n\nTerms of Use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

      "description": "• Featured as \"New and Noteworthy\" and \"Staff Favorite\" by Apple.\n• Over 500,000 copies downloaded.\n• Ranked in Top 25 Music Apps for 14 consecutive months.\n\nAccess and stream your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch Music Library directly over WiFi from an Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, Chromecast or any compatible DLNA device. No Wires or special hardware needed! It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player.\n\nIf you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you!\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n√ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC.\n\n√ Start AirMusic.\n\n√ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list.\n\n√ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list.\n\n√ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead.\n\n√ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store.\n\n√ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them.\n\n• If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music.\n\n• AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. \n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes. Newer iTunes DRM free purchases are compatible.\n\n• When using Chromecast, you can choose and change the music directly from within AirMusic. For all other devices, you do it from these devices (ie Xbox, PS3, PC).\n\nIf you are experiencing any other issues, please contact us at airmusic@plutinosoft.com. We can't help you if we don't hear from you!\n\nAirMusic is Copyright © Plutinosoft, LLC\nPowered by Platinum UPnP SDK http://plutinosoft.com/platinum",

        "description": "• Featured as \"New and Noteworthy\" and \"Staff Favorite\" by Apple.\n• Over 500,000 copies downloaded.\n• Ranked in Top 25 Music Apps for 14 consecutive months.\n\nAccess and stream your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch Music Library directly over WiFi from an Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, Chromecast or any compatible DLNA device. No Wires or special hardware needed! It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player.\n\nIf you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you!\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n√ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC.\n\n√ Start AirMusic.\n\n√ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list.\n\n√ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list.\n\n√ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead.\n\n√ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store.\n\n√ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream.\n\n√ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'.\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music.\n\n• AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them.\n\n• If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music.\n\n• AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. \n\n• AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes. Newer iTunes DRM free purchases are compatible.\n\n• When using Chromecast, you can choose and change the music directly from within AirMusic. For all other devices, you do it from these devices (ie Xbox, PS3, PC).\n\nIf you are experiencing any other issues, please contact us at airmusic@plutinosoft.com. We can't help you if we don't hear from you!\n\nAirMusic is Copyright © Plutinosoft, LLC\nPowered by Platinum UPnP SDK http://plutinosoft.com/platinum",

      "description": "Larix Broadcaster is a professional streaming camera app for video and audio contribution using SRT, RTMP, Zixi, NDI, WebRTC, RTSP, and RIST protocols. It is built for mobile journalism, IRL streaming, remote production, and other live broadcasting workflows.\n\nThe app supports live streaming from iOS devices with high performance and flexibility. It offers H.264 and HEVC (H.265) video encoding, and AAC or Opus audio depending on protocol. It supports SRT in Caller, Listener, and Rendezvous modes (libsrt v1.5.3), with multipoint listener functionality. RTMP and RTSP are available with SSL (RTMPS/RTSPS). WebRTC is supported through WHIP signaling. Zixi integration provides AVC/HEVC support, SEI metadata, and Grove compatibility. NDI HX2 offers preview, Discovery Server support, and metadata setup with SDK 6.2.0. RIST streaming is supported in Push mode with Main and Simple profiles via librist v0.2.7.\n\nYou can configure multiple connection profiles and stream to several destinations simultaneously. The app includes a stand-by stream mode to launch in a paused state with different overlay settings. Pause is also supported to send muted sound and replace camera with alternate content.\n\nTalkback is available via SRT, RTMP, Icecast, and SLDP, enabling audio return.\n\nLarix supports UltraHD resolution and Dolby Vision HDR (via the HDR video menu). Both front and back cameras are supported, with live flipping, rotation between portrait and landscape, and hot switching. Multi-camera capture with picture-in-picture and side-by-side modes is available on iPhone XR, XS, and newer devices. It supports dual/triple camera setups including wide and telephoto lenses. Center Stage for iPads is also supported.\n\nCamera controls include auto-exposure lock, white balance lock, manual color temperature, and pinch-to-zoom.\n\n\nAdaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) is supported for SRT, with options for logarithmic descent, ladder ascent, and hybrid adjustment. Variable frame rate is also supported. ABR is disabled by default and can be enabled in the Video settings.\n\nBluetooth audio input and audio-only streaming are supported.\n\nUSB camera input is available on iPadOS 17 and later.\n\nYou can record streams as MP4 files, take screenshots, and save to iCloud. Recording customization allows higher resolution, alternate compatibility settings, and input gain control.\n\nSEI metadata can be inserted into SRT, WebRTC, and RTMP streams for NTP sync using the Advanced menu.\n\nOverlay features include GPS-based HTML overlays (requires Larix Premium), image, text, HTML layers, date/time overlays using Unicode LDML, and web widgets. You can assign specific overlays to live, paused, or stand-by states, and enable or disable layers while streaming.\n\n\nLarix Grove enables easy sharing via deep links or QR codes. Visit https://softvelum.com/larix/grove/ for details.\n\nLarix Broadcaster supports streaming to any media destinations including Nimble Streamer, Wowza, Red5, Flussonic, vMix, OBS Studio, and others. It works with major platforms like YouTube Live, Facebook Live, Twitch, Kick, Restream.io, Dacast, Cloudflare Stream, and more.\n\nLarix Tuner cloud service support adds remote control, configuration backup, and session statistics. Visit the Larix Tuner website for more information.\n\nMany features require a Larix Premium subscription. Premium removes the default overlay. It also unlocks multiple simultaneous outputs, Talkback, advanced overlays, ABR streaming, WHIP publishing, stream auto-start, USB/UVC camera support, and other.

        "description": "Larix Broadcaster is a professional streaming camera app for video and audio contribution using SRT, RTMP, Zixi, NDI, WebRTC, RTSP, and RIST protocols. It is built for mobile journalism, IRL streaming, remote production, and other live broadcasting workflows.\n\nThe app supports live streaming from iOS devices with high performance and flexibility. It offers H.264 and HEVC (H.265) video encoding, and AAC or Opus audio depending on protocol. It supports SRT in Caller, Listener, and Rendezvous modes (libsrt v1.5.3), with multipoint listener functionality. RTMP and RTSP are available with SSL (RTMPS/RTSPS). WebRTC is supported through WHIP signaling. Zixi integration provides AVC/HEVC support, SEI metadata, and Grove compatibility. NDI HX2 offers preview, Discovery Server support, and metadata setup with SDK 6.2.0. RIST streaming is supported in Push mode with Main and Simple profiles via librist v0.2.7.\n\nYou can configure multiple connection profiles and stream to several destinations simultaneously. The app includes a stand-by stream mode to launch in a paused state with different overlay settings. Pause is also supported to send muted sound and replace camera with alternate content.\n\nTalkback is available via SRT, RTMP, Icecast, and SLDP, enabling audio return.\n\nLarix supports UltraHD resolution and Dolby Vision HDR (via the HDR video menu). Both front and back cameras are supported, with live flipping, rotation between portrait and landscape, and hot switching. Multi-camera capture with picture-in-picture and side-by-side modes is available on iPhone XR, XS, and newer devices. It supports dual/triple camera setups including wide and telephoto lenses. Center Stage for iPads is also supported.\n\nCamera controls include auto-exposure lock, white balance lock, manual color temperature, and pinch-to-zoom.\n\n\nAdaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) is supported for SRT, with options for logarithmic descent, ladder ascent, and hybrid adjustment. Variable frame rate is also supported. ABR is disabled by default and can be enabled in the Video settings.\n\nBluetooth audio input and audio-only streaming are supported.\n\nUSB camera input is available on iPadOS 17 and later.\n\nYou can record streams as MP4 files, take screenshots, and save to iCloud. Recording customization allows higher resolution, alternate compatibility settings, and input gain control.\n\nSEI metadata can be inserted into SRT, WebRTC, and RTMP streams for NTP sync using the Advanced menu.\n\nOverlay features include GPS-based HTML overlays (requires Larix Premium), image, text, HTML layers, date/time overlays using Unicode LDML, and web widgets. You can assign specific overlays to live, paused, or stand-by states, and enable or disable layers while streaming.\n\n\nLarix Grove enables easy sharing via deep links or QR codes. Visit https://softvelum.com/larix/grove/ for details.\n\nLarix Broadcaster supports streaming to any media destinations including Nimble Streamer, Wowza, Red5, Flussonic, vMix, OBS Studio, and others. It works with major platforms like YouTube Live, Facebook Live, Twitch, Kick, Restream.io, Dacast, Cloudflare Stream, and more.\n\nLarix Tuner cloud service support adds remote control, configuration backup, and session statistics. Visit the Larix Tuner website for more information.\n\nMany features require a Larix Premium subscription. Premium removes the default overlay. It also unlocks multiple simultaneous outputs, Talkback, advanced overlays, ABR streaming, WHIP publishing, stream auto-start, USB/UVC camera support, and other.

      "description": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your Amazon Fire TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

        "description": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your Amazon Fire TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "description": "You love your music. In fact, you have the biggest collection of albums and individual songs of anyone you know and you listen to your playlists as often and for as long as you possibly can. Now, thanks to iSub Music Streamer, you’re enjoying your favorite songs everywhere you go, even at work or on a long plane ride.\n\niSub is an incredible app that lets you stream all of that music—even your concert recordings, DJ mixes, and audio books—from your home computer directly to your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad over WiFi and mobile data. \n\niSub streams your music from any Subsonic compatible server (Subsonic, Airsonic, Madsonic, and others). There’s no central service to rely on and it's all your own music, so you never have to worry about songs randomly going missing when their licensing runs out like on some streaming services. \n\nIt doesn’t matter the size or file format of your collection; iSub can handle it all thanks to native support for popular lossless and lossy file formats like MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC, OGG, and OPUS. Save your limited mobile data when on the go thanks to Subsonic’s ability to transcode your songs to a lower bitrate as they play, and listen to your high-resolution lossless FLAC files when at home or on a WiFi connection.\n\niSub isn’t just about listening, either.
