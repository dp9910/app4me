      "description": "When in doubt, go for takeout—Grubhub has it all! Order food delivery from thousands of restaurants, including local spots and national chains, and get groceries delivered too. Prefer pickup? No problem. Know the fees upfront and track orders from Grubhub delivery partners in real time—the only surprise is just how easy takeout can be. \n\nORDER FROM THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS\nWith Grubhub, you can order takeout from your favorite local restaurants and everyone’s favorite chains. There are so many good eats out there, but you obviously deserve the best. Grubhub makes it easier to choose your next meal with restaurant ratings and reviews. French fries, pizza, burritos, burgers, sushi, donuts—it’s all here, whenever a craving strikes. \n\nGET GROCERIES DELIVERED TOO\nThink beyond your breakfast, lunch, and dinner orders. Grubhub offers the ultimate convenience with grocery delivery, in addition to restaurant takeout. Order milk, bread, snacks, and frozen foods, as well as household essentials like paper towels and laundry detergent, from local convenience stores.  \n\nEXPECT TO SEE THE FEES UPFRONT\nGrubhub gives it to you straight. See the delivery fee upfront, before you start crafting the perfect food order. Pay your way with credit cards, Grubhub gift cards, or Venmo.\n\nSKIP DELIVERY FEES\nThe key is Grubhub+. Sign up for unlimited $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, and enjoy exclusive offers and rewards as a Grubhub+ member.* Try Grubhub+ free for 30 days, then level up for just $9.99/month. The truth is, food tastes even better when you spend less on delivery. See details below.\n\nTRACK DELIVERY IN REAL TIME\nGrubhub puts your delivery on the map. Track eligible orders in real time, from the restaurant to your front door, and know the moment your bacon-egg-and-cheese arrives. Every delivery is a special delivery with Grubhub. \n\nCOUNT ON THE GRUBHUB GUARANTEE\nGet your food delivered on time and at the lowest price. Guaranteed, or we’ll make it right. See details: grubhub.com/guarantee\n\nYOU DO YOU AND GRUBHUB DELIVERS\nGrubhub serves up a personalized app experience, so you can reorder that feast you’re still thinking about from two months ago. Order sauce on the side, go for extra pickles, lose the onions—Grubhub gets you. Are you a regular? Get rewarded when you come back for more at the same restaurants. You can also plan ahead by pre-ordering food for pickup or delivery. \n\nORDER FROM NATIONAL RESTAURANTS\nSometimes you need a sure thing, and that’s why Grubhub partners with national restaurants to offer the takeout food you know and love. Get delivery from Applebee’s, Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Denny’s, Dunkin’, Five Guys, IHOP, McDonald’s, KFC, Panda Express, Panera, Papa John’s, Popeyes, Shake Shack, Subway, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, White Castle, and more.\n\nGET SUPPORT WHEN YOU NEED IT\nBurning questions? Delivery crisis? Grubhub customer support is here for you 24/7. \n\n*$0 delivery fees only apply to eligible delivery orders from Grubhub+ merchants that meet the subtotal minimum (before tax, tip, and fees) on the applicable menu page or otherwise indicated on the Grubhub platform. Grubhub+ is an automatically renewing membership service requiring recurring payments. After your free trial ends, your free trial will convert to a paid Grubhub+ membership and Grubhub will automatically charge you each month at the then-current rate (currently $9.99) plus tax until you cancel.

      "description": "Virtuagym Food: Helping you to live healthy and feel great. Get a free personalized nutrition plan by answering a few questions about your lifestyle and goals. We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

        "description": "Virtuagym Food: Helping you to live healthy and feel great. Get a free personalized nutrition plan by answering a few questions about your lifestyle and goals. We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

      "description": "When in doubt, go for takeout—Seamless has it all. Plus, fun fact: Seamless is powered by Grubhub! Order food delivery from thousands of restaurants, including local spots and national chains, and get groceries delivered too. Prefer pickup? No problem. Know the fees upfront and track orders from Seamless delivery partners in real time. The only surprise is just how easy takeout can be. \n\nORDER FROM THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS\nWith Seamless, you can order takeout from your favorite local restaurants and everyone’s favorite chains.

French fries, pizza, burritos, burgers, sushi, donuts—it’s all here, whenever a craving strikes. \n\nGET GROCERIES DELIVERED TOO\nThink beyond your breakfast, lunch, and dinner orders. Seamless offers the ultimate convenience with grocery delivery, in addition to restaurant takeout.

Terms and conditions apply. See details: flashfood.com/terms\n\nNeed help? We’re here. Reach out on live chat from the app or email us at support@flashfood.com.\n\nWe care about your privacy (for real). Read about it at flashfood.com/privacy \n\nTo learn more about our impact, where we operate, and our plans for the future, visit flashfood.com.",

        "description": "Ritual brings people together with the best takeout spots near their work or home neighborhoods. We connect you with those local gems, the hot new restaurants, and your favorite chains. We believe it’s those real world connections — when the barista knows your name, the chef knows just how you like your order, or being greeted like a regular from your very first visit — that make communities, and the people and places in them, thrive.\n\nOrder ahead and ditch the wait.\nNo more waiting in line to order, or killing time while your meal is being prepped. We’ll notify you exactly when it’s time to go pick up your food — so you get your latte, salad, taco, burrito, sushi, burger, pizza, poke or pad thai at its freshest. \n\nMenu options? Oh, we have them.\nBreakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in between. Choose from hundreds of restaurants near you, and thousands of menu choices. Search by cuisine style or restaurant proximity. Quickly reorder your faves or discover new places. Easily customize your orders too. Whatever you’re in the mood for, find it in the App.\n\nBe the office hero.\nDoing a lunch or coffee run? Get your coworkers in on it. With Piggyback, it’s easy to create work teams and place group orders. No more counting back change, or figuring out who’s paid. Earn bonus points (from us, and with your colleagues) when you pick up, plus get in some daily steps! 10 coffees, one easy and rewarding run — epic.\n\nGet rewarded with Loyalty+.\nGot a go-to breakfast, lunch or coffee spot? Earn extra rewards for those daily rituals. With Loyalty+, you collect stamps at your favorite local participating restaurants. Redeem those stamps for free food. Repeat. It’s a delicious cycle.\n\nEnjoy easy and secure payment.\nThousands of local spots, one quick and easy way to pay. Save your personal or company credit card in the app, and pay with a tap. Your data is encrypted, so we or the restaurant never see your number. And your card or cash stays in your wallet, for safe, contact-free payments and pick ups.\n\nReward employees with Ritual for Companies.\nOur corporate teams program makes it easy to reward employees through credits, meal plans, and other perks. Create employee meal plans that work with your team’s size & budget, and support favorite local merchants through targeted incentives.

It recommends a feed of dishes rather than restaurants, thus a step closer to your decision on what to eat.\n\nOther than smart food recommendation, you can also search for nearby dishes & restaurants if you already have your own preferences in mind, or you can browse a recommended list of dishes. You can also like dishes so you can revisit them later; follow restaurants to get their updates; share your thoughts by adding reviews, etc.\n\nFoodSpot gets smarter to recommend food you may like. The more you use it, the more smarter FoodSpot becomes. Help share FoodSpot apps with your friends so they can also enjoy the possibilities around them!",

      "description": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\nFill your life with movement. Get the whole city in your hands, ride wherever you want, and enjoy comfort at an affordable price. With Yango, everything is possible!\n\nChoose the right service class for you\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn’t matter and you just need the closest ride available!\n\nRide safely\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\nYango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\nYango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. \n\nRequest rides for close ones\nShow you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.\n\nRefer friends and get discounts\nInvite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It’s as easy as that.\n\nMeet Delivery - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier anywhere in the city. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car. \n\nAn international service\nYango is a ride-hailing, mobility, and delivery aggregator service that operates in more than 20 countries around the world, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties.\nThe size and duration of the discount for the first rides requested via the Yango app vary depending on the country and city. Open the app for specific details.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions",

        "description": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\nFill your life with movement. Get the whole city in your hands, ride wherever you want, and enjoy comfort at an affordable price. With Yango, everything is possible!\n\nChoose the right service class for you\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Economy is awesome for when you need a ride fast. Comfort lets you sit back and just enjoy the ride. And The Fastest is the best in case when the service class doesn’t matter and you just need the closest ride available!\n\nRide safely\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see info about the driver, such as their name and rating, and will be able to share your route with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\nYango will suggest destinations for your rides based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common request on weekday evenings. Ride the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\nYango makes everyday life super easy. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. \n\nRequest rides for close ones\nShow you care by requesting rides for friends and relatives. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment, book a ride to pick up your special someone, or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can request up to 3 cars at once.\n\nRefer friends and get discounts\nInvite friends to try Yango and save together. Share your personal promo code, get a discount on your next ride and grant your friend with an extra discount on their first ride. It’s as easy as that.\n\nMeet Delivery - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier anywhere in the city. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car. \n\nAn international service\nYango is a ride-hailing, mobility, and delivery aggregator service that operates in more than 20 countries around the world, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties.\nThe size and duration of the discount for the first rides requested via the Yango app vary depending on the country and city. Open the app for specific details.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions",
