(Yeah, we said the thing…)\n\n\nOur creators march to the beat of their own drum, as do we, disrupting our opps with a 95-5 subscription split, our creator incentive program, and the freedom to multistream.\n\n\nThat’s why the likes of xQc, Amouranth, and MaxHolloway all pick Kick.\n\n\nFor viewers, it’s the fear of missing out that compels them to tune in, the chance to be part of internet culture, all in real-time and ad-free.\n\n\nbut lets be real, no one reads these, so if youve made it this far, at least give the app 5 stars. it will good for my performance review. thanks :)\n\n\nP.S.

(Yeah, we said the thing…)\n\n\nOur creators march to the beat of their own drum, as do we, disrupting our opps with a 95-5 subscription split, our creator incentive program, and the freedom to multistream.\n\n\nThat’s why the likes of xQc, Amouranth, and MaxHolloway all pick Kick.\n\n\nFor viewers, it’s the fear of missing out that compels them to tune in, the chance to be part of internet culture, all in real-time and ad-free.\n\n\nbut lets be real, no one reads these, so if youve made it this far, at least give the app 5 stars. it will good for my performance review. thanks :)\n\n\nP.S.

      "description": "Connect to Philips Hue Entertainment, LIFX, and Nanoleaf Light Panels and take command of your music & entertainment lighting needs. Customize one of over 100+ lighting effects using the app's 3 unique light controllers, or create your own custom effects. Light DJ has been used in lots of creative applications, including special effects for home DJs, house parties, stage & video productions, holiday decorations, mood lighting for bars & restaurants, haunted houses, or just to create the ultimate music listening experience in your living room. Light DJ is the #1 app for configurable entertainment effects for smart lighting.\n\nMUSIC VISUALIZER: Create the ultimate music listening experience. The app listens to your music and changes the effects based on the mood of the song. Lights get active during intense parts of a song and flowy with softer melodies and magically change colors at just the right moment. Special controls for Nanoleaf allow you to control rotation and fill angle to match your Aurora or Canvas panel orientation.\n\nBEAT-SYNCED EFFECTS: Use the Super SceneMaker controller for looping effects that sync to the beat of your music. Each of the 100+ effects can be customized with your favorite colors. Play and mix local audio tracks into your playlists and sheets or select one from Apple Music.\n\nHUE ENTERTAINMENT: Using a Hue Entertainment area you'll enjoy higher quality effects; all of Light DJ's effects respond faster and with better sync. Send waves of color across your room with the updated Groove Wave effect, or strobe faster with the Matrix controller.\n\nEFFECT MAKER: Create your own looping special effects with our powerful Effects Maker. Share your custom-made effects & sheets using AirDrop.\n\nIPAD VERSION: A DJ controller-inspired design for ultimate live-performance lighting control. Configurable sheets allow you to setup your effects and colors in advance, and the push-button interface lets making rapid changes easy.\n\nSTUFF FOR DJs: Precision tempo controls allows you to sync the lights with your set. Optional automatic beat detection using your device's built-in microphone. Also supports Ableton Link and MIDI Clock Sync for syncing tempo across devices, and MIDI Program Change or Control Change codes for controlling effects. \n\nLight DJ offers monthly and yearly subscription options. Each subscription includes:\n-Full use of all of the app's controllers and effects\n-Universal access & cloud sync\n-Continual updates to support new hardware and features\n-Direct email technical support (I respond to every email!)\n-For more details see lightdjapp.com/blog\n\nVisit lightdjapp.com for support and previews.\n\nThis app requires hardware from one of these vendors:\n- Philips Hue: meethue.com\n- LIFX: lifx.com\n- Nanoleaf lights and panels (Shapes, Canvas, Lines, Elements, Blocks, Skylight, EXPO Cases, Aurora, A19 bulbs, LED strips, multicolor floor lamp, outdoor permanent and string lights, and holiday lights): nanoleaf.me\n\nYour purchase will be applied to your iTunes account at the end of the trial. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.\n\nTerms of Use: Subscription includes full access to the app including cloud backup & sync, periodic feature updates, and new light hardware support.\n\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Use: http://lightdjapp.com/terms\n\n------------------------------\n\nHi, I’m Kevin, the creator of Light DJ. I want everyone to have an incredible light show experience! If you’re having trouble connecting to your lights, don’t hesitate to email me at kevin@nrthrnlights.com. I’m here to help and always working to make Light DJ the best it can be.",

        "description": "Connect to Philips Hue Entertainment, LIFX, and Nanoleaf Light Panels and take command of your music & entertainment lighting needs. Customize one of over 100+ lighting effects using the app's 3 unique light controllers, or create your own custom effects. Light DJ has been used in lots of creative applications, including special effects for home DJs, house parties, stage & video productions, holiday decorations, mood lighting for bars & restaurants, haunted houses, or just to create the ultimate music listening experience in your living room. Light DJ is the #1 app for configurable entertainment effects for smart lighting.\n\nMUSIC VISUALIZER: Create the ultimate music listening experience. The app listens to your music and changes the effects based on the mood of the song. Lights get active during intense parts of a song and flowy with softer melodies and magically change colors at just the right moment. Special controls for Nanoleaf allow you to control rotation and fill angle to match your Aurora or Canvas panel orientation.\n\nBEAT-SYNCED EFFECTS: Use the Super SceneMaker controller for looping effects that sync to the beat of your music. Each of the 100+ effects can be customized with your favorite colors. Play and mix local audio tracks into your playlists and sheets or select one from Apple Music.\n\nHUE ENTERTAINMENT: Using a Hue Entertainment area you'll enjoy higher quality effects; all of Light DJ's effects respond faster and with better sync. Send waves of color across your room with the updated Groove Wave effect, or strobe faster with the Matrix controller.\n\nEFFECT MAKER: Create your own looping special effects with our powerful Effects Maker. Share your custom-made effects & sheets using AirDrop.\n\nIPAD VERSION: A DJ controller-inspired design for ultimate live-performance lighting control. Configurable sheets allow you to setup your effects and colors in advance, and the push-button interface lets making rapid changes easy.\n\nSTUFF FOR DJs: Precision tempo controls allows you to sync the lights with your set. Optional automatic beat detection using your device's built-in microphone. Also supports Ableton Link and MIDI Clock Sync for syncing tempo across devices, and MIDI Program Change or Control Change codes for controlling effects. \n\nLight DJ offers monthly and yearly subscription options. Each subscription includes:\n-Full use of all of the app's controllers and effects\n-Universal access & cloud sync\n-Continual updates to support new hardware and features\n-Direct email technical support (I respond to every email!)\n-For more details see lightdjapp.com/blog\n\nVisit lightdjapp.com for support and previews.\n\nThis app requires hardware from one of these vendors:\n- Philips Hue: meethue.com\n- LIFX: lifx.com\n- Nanoleaf lights and panels (Shapes, Canvas, Lines, Elements, Blocks, Skylight, EXPO Cases, Aurora, A19 bulbs, LED strips, multicolor floor lamp, outdoor permanent and string lights, and holiday lights): nanoleaf.me\n\nYour purchase will be applied to your iTunes account at the end of the trial.
