As they play, their wizards get stronger, collect more items and unlock more zones. \n\nWith Prodigy Math Game, kids don’t have to choose between homework time and playtime!

      "description": "Mental Math is fun with Math Balance - kids help Toby reach home by balancing bridges and while they have fun, they also learn about equality/comparison, gain flexibility with numbers and practice skills that are essential for understanding algebra. \n\nThis mental math game with 30 levels will help your child get necessary fluidity with numbers. Your child will learn things like addition can happen in any order for the same result, or that sum of different numbers can add up to be the same number. They will also end up having to use different number strategies, such as bridging and compensation which can significantly speed up their mental math computations. \n\nThese are the skills covered by Math Balance -  \n\n- Developing meaning of equal sign, using, greater than and less than sign\n- Set up numbers in their expanded form\n- Commutative property of addition and, later, using it and expanded form as a strategy to add ex: 67+25 = 60+7+20+5 = 80+12 =92\n- Missing Addend strategies:x+b=c, where x is to be found, situations where difference is unknown, where there is a bigger unknown and where there is a smaller unknown -one step problems                   \n- Showing that addition and subtraction are inverse; 4+5=9, 9-5=4\n- Use only doubles, Use only even/odd numbers to get to a total            \n- 1 step word problems -Change unknown, Result unknown, Start unknown\n- add a string of two-digit numbers (up to four numbers) by applying place value strategies and properties of operations.\nExample: 43 + 34 + 57 + 24 = __\n- Using concrete models to show addition and subtraction \n- Mentally add 10 or 100 to a given number 100–900, and mentally subtract 10 or 100 from a given number 100–900\n- Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction\n- Multiplication as repeated addition\n\nFor those who follow the Core curriculum, this maps to the following core standards - 2.OA.B.2, 2.NBT.4, 2.OA.2, 1.OA.6, 2.OA.C.3, 2.OA.1, 2.NBT.6, 2.NBT.7, 2.NBT.8, 3.NBT.2.\n\nSubscription info:\n\n- Math Balance can be purchased standalone, or as part of a makkajai Genius subscription. \n- Makkajai Genius subscriptions are auto-renewable and annual. ($59.99/yr) \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n- Cancellation will not go into effect until the end of the monthly billing cycle\n\nFor support, questions or comments, write to us at: support@makkajai.com\nOur privacy policy can be found at: http://www.makkajai.com/privacy-policy and our terms can be found at: https://www.makkajai.com/terms",

        "description": "Mental Math is fun with Math Balance - kids help Toby reach home by balancing bridges and while they have fun, they also learn about equality/comparison, gain flexibility with numbers and practice skills that are essential for understanding algebra. \n\nThis mental math game with 30 levels will help your child get necessary fluidity with numbers. Your child will learn things like addition can happen in any order for the same result, or that sum of different numbers can add up to be the same number. They will also end up having to use different number strategies, such as bridging and compensation which can significantly speed up their mental math computations. \n\nThese are the skills covered by Math Balance -  \n\n- Developing meaning of equal sign, using, greater than and less than sign\n- Set up numbers in their expanded form\n- Commutative property of addition and, later, using it and expanded form as a strategy to add ex: 67+25 = 60+7+20+5 = 80+12 =92\n- Missing Addend strategies:x+b=c, where x is to be found, situations where difference is unknown, where there is a bigger unknown and where there is a smaller unknown -one step problems                   \n- Showing that addition and subtraction are inverse; 4+5=9, 9-5=4\n- Use only doubles, Use only even/odd numbers to get to a total            \n- 1 step word problems -Change unknown, Result unknown, Start unknown\n- add a string of two-digit numbers (up to four numbers) by applying place value strategies and properties of operations.\nExample: 43 + 34 + 57 + 24 = __\n- Using concrete models to show addition and subtraction \n- Mentally add 10 or 100 to a given number 100–900, and mentally subtract 10 or 100 from a given number 100–900\n- Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction\n- Multiplication as repeated addition\n\nFor those who follow the Core curriculum, this maps to the following core standards - 2.OA.B.2, 2.NBT.4, 2.OA.2, 1.OA.6, 2.OA.C.3, 2.OA.1, 2.NBT.6, 2.NBT.7, 2.NBT.8, 3.NBT.2.\n\nSubscription info:\n\n- Math Balance can be purchased standalone, or as part of a makkajai Genius subscription. \n- Makkajai Genius subscriptions are auto-renewable and annual. ($59.99/yr) \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase\n- Cancellation will not go into effect until the end of the monthly billing cycle\n\nFor support, questions or comments, write to us at: support@makkajai.com\nOur privacy policy can be found at: http://www.makkajai.com/privacy-policy and our terms can be found at: https://www.makkajai.com/terms",

      "description": "Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profits, and anyone with a personal Google account. Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

        "description": "Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profits, and anyone with a personal Google account. Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

Was it an EM:RAP chapter on sickle cell disease? Could it have been a UC Max chapter on the SHAAKE assessment? Now that you think about it, it could have been from C3—pediatric abdominal pain, maybe. Whatever it was, the telephone call from your mother-in-law reminding you it’s your turn to bring the Jell-O salad for Sunday dinner threw you for a loop and now you’re no longer sure where you left off.\n\nDon’t worry. We here at EM:RAP routinely forget why we’ve walked into a room, where we’ve left our phones—or even that we were supposed to pick up the kids from school an hour ago. It’s human nature. And to help deal with human nature, we’ve added a new feature to the iOS app. Now when you start the app, it will launch the mini player preloaded with the last thing you listened to, but which you haven’t yet finished. We’ve also snuck in a few small bug fixes under the hood to keep the app humming along as usual.\n\nIt’s just one more way EM:RAP has your back, so give it a shot! Oh, and don’t forget to bring that Jell-O salad on Sunday. We’d hate to see you arrive empty-handed.",

This creates a connection between the Learning Outcomes covered in the class and students’ evidence of learning.\n\nTeachers can tag any standards available on ManageBac, including IB, PYP Scope & Sequences, Pearson, Cambridge, and all Atlas Standards, ensuring comprehensive coverage across programmes. By tagging standards, teachers can highlight the skills and competencies demonstrated by students, creating a clear connection between teaching and learning.\n\nTogether, these updates empower teachers to connect learning to the curriculum, identify gaps in skill development, and gain meaningful insights into student progress.",

Come with a question and leave with a full exploration.\n\nPony Education teaches hairstylists how to look at the individual client and give something beautiful and interesting and suited to them and teaches the techniques to get there rather than teaching paint by number haircuts and putting them on heads.”\n— JAYNE MATTHEWS, OWNER, EDO SALON\n\n“It’s finally something that helps us! Not a cookie cutter technique of one thing! They are offering a variety of creative classes with a cool yet realistic twist!”\n— JANIE NAFFZ, OWNER, ARGONAUTA (AUBURN, CA)\n\n“Take the best educators who freelance because they truly love to teach, add to an intimate setting where you are free to ask as many questions as you like, see inspiration and demonstrations that open your creative eye and get your hands in the hair that day on carefully curated live models. What more do you need?”\n— ADRIENNE, DEEDA SALON (SACRAMENTO)\n\n“I would highly recommend Pony. I liked that it was somewhat intimate so asking questions was comfortable all around and the visual aspect was great at all angles. The instructor made sure we understood conceptually and visually. The class/course was well organized, so no lost time on the trivial stuff. I walked away wanting more!”\n— MAXIE, RINGOLEVIO SALON & SPA (SF)\n\n“If you are filling like you have holes in your skills or feeling stuck in same old thing. This is for you.

      "description": "Learning a language can be an experience that transforms your life. Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nWhat are people saying about Rosetta Stone:\n• CNN Underscored - \"There’s a good reason why the language learning app Rosetta Stone is the gros chien (that is, the big dog) of the apps we tested\"\n• Mashable - \"one of the OG language-learning services, known for its deep dive into accent pronunciation\"\n• Popular Science - \"super-smooth and intuitive, and the lessons neither feel too short so as to be forgettable nor too long so as to be a chore\"\n• PC Mag - \"reliable, accurate, and thorough\"\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next. From day one, you’ll: \n• Stay focused with a personalized language learning plan based on your motivation. \n• Learn a language intuitively using our proven immersion method. \n• Perfect your pronunciation with instantaneous feedback. \n• Download lessons to do everything offline.  \n• Access different kinds of exercises with our Extended Learning features. \n• Sync progress across all your devices. \n• And never see an ad, ever. \n\n\n\nFor the first time, we’re offering every one of our languages under one subscription. Flip between languages as often as you’d like and enjoy the freedom to get seriously curious. To access, simply select Unlimited Languages when you subscribe. \n\n\nChoose from 24 languages: \nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, English (American or British), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin American or Spain), Swedish, Turkish, or Vietnamese. \n\n\n\nSelect a subscription: \nWe offer 3 and 12-month subscriptions—as well as a Lifetime option. \n\n\n\nSubscription Details:\n• Get full access to all lessons, stories, and audio companion when you subscribe to Rosetta Stone. \n• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID. \n• Your account will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• Manage or cancel your subscription from your App Store User Settings at any time after purchasing. Payment will be taken until the end of the current period.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\n\nEnterprise and Education Learners\n• Unlimited use of Rosetta Stone's mobile app is available for existing Enterprise and Education Learners.\n• Features may vary for Enterprise and Education Learners.\n\n\nFor questions or assistance, please visit http://support.rosettastone.com\n\n\n\nLearn a language today with Rosetta Stone.\n\n\nLearn Spanish (Latin American or Spain)\nLearn French\nLearn German\nLearn Italian\nLearn English (American or British)\nLearn Japanese\nLearn Korean\nLearn Chinese (Mandarin)\nLearn Arabic\nLearn Portuguese (Brazil)\nLearn Russian\nLearn Dutch\nLearn Filipino (Tagalog)\nLearn Greek\nLearn Hebrew\nLearn Hindi\nLearn Irish\nLearn Persian (Farsi)\nLearn Polish\nLearn Swedish\nLearn Turkish\nLearn Vietnamese\n\n\n\nFor questions or assistance, please visit http://support.rosettastone.com",

        "description": "Learning a language can be an experience that transforms your life. Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nWhat are people saying about Rosetta Stone:\n• CNN Underscored - \"There’s a good reason why the language learning app Rosetta Stone is the gros chien (that is, the big dog) of the apps we tested\"\n• Mashable - \"one of the OG language-learning services, known for its deep dive into accent pronunciation\"\n• Popular Science - \"super-smooth and intuitive, and the lessons neither feel too short so as to be forgettable nor too long so as to be a chore\"\n• PC Mag - \"reliable, accurate, and thorough\"\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next. From day one, you’ll: \n• Stay focused with a personalized language learning plan based on your motivation. \n• Learn a language intuitively using our proven immersion method. \n• Perfect your pronunciation with instantaneous feedback. \n• Download lessons to do everything offline.  \n• Access different kinds of exercises with our Extended Learning features. \n• Sync progress across all your devices. \n• And never see an ad, ever. \n\n\n\nFor the first time, we’re offering every one of our languages under one subscription. Flip between languages as often as you’d like and enjoy the freedom to get seriously curious. To access, simply select Unlimited Languages when you subscribe. \n\n\nChoose from 24 languages: \nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, English (American or British), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin American or Spain), Swedish, Turkish, or Vietnamese. \n\n\n\nSelect a subscription: \nWe offer 3 and 12-month subscriptions—as well as a Lifetime option. \n\n\n\nSubscription Details:\n• Get full access to all lessons, stories, and audio companion when you subscribe to Rosetta Stone. \n• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID. \n• Your account will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• Manage or cancel your subscription from your App Store User Settings at any time after purchasing. Payment will be taken until the end of the current period.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\n\nEnterprise and Education Learners\n• Unlimited use of Rosetta Stone's mobile app is available for existing Enterprise and Education Learners.\n• Features may vary for Enterprise and Education Learners.\n\n\nFor questions or assistance, please visit http://support.rosettastone.com\n\n\n\nLearn a language today with Rosetta Stone.\n\n\nLearn Spanish (Latin American or Spain)\nLearn French\nLearn German\nLearn Italian\nLearn English (American or British)\nLearn Japanese\nLearn Korean\nLearn Chinese (Mandarin)\nLearn Arabic\nLearn Portuguese (Brazil)\nLearn Russian\nLearn Dutch\nLearn Filipino (Tagalog)\nLearn Greek\nLearn Hebrew\nLearn Hindi\nLearn Irish\nLearn Persian (Farsi)\nLearn Polish\nLearn Swedish\nLearn Turkish\nLearn Vietnamese\n\n\n\nFor questions or assistance, please visit http://support.rosettastone.com",
