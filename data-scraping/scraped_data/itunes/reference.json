      "description": "Classic Words is the best word game to play against your iPhone or iPad (solitaire mode). Scrabble for victory and enrich your vocabulary thanks to the built-in word definitions!\n6 languages are supported: English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Dutch.\n\nTired of stumbling across cheaters or waiting for hours for your online opponent to play in multiplayer games?\nTry out Classic Words for instant fun, no matter if you are a beginner in crossword games or a tournament player!\n\nChoose the difficulty level (from beginner to expert), pick a word list, and use your strategy skills and vocabulary to try and defeat the iPhone. The English word lists included in the game are inspired by the official lists used in Scrabble tournaments: NWL and SOWPODS.\n\nClassic Words gameplay is classical to crosswords board games: create and place words on the board and boost your score by placing letters on the high-scoring Double Letter, Double Word, Triple Letter, and Triple Word squares.\nUse all 7 letters from your rack to play a Bingo and get a 50-point bonus.\n\nThis game is a great time killer for all fans of board games and strategy games. It is also an educational game that will allow kids (and adults :-) ) to improve their spelling and vocabulary. \n\nThanks to the fast reactivity of the artificial intelligence (AI) and to the official word lists, Classic Words can be used by traditional word game enthusiasts to play quick training matches and learn new words from the computer's moves.\n\nUnlike with multiplayer board games, where some dishonest players use anagram solvers, there is no cheating possible when playing in solitaire... Letters and blanks are always picked randomly, and the computer's artificial intelligence does not have more information than you do.\n\nOnly your tactics and creativity can make the difference...\nWill you play strategically enough to outwit the computer and its extensive vocabulary?\n\nEXCLUSIVE FEATURES:\n- 6 levels of difficulty\n- Automatic display of the definition of the iPhone words\n- Distribution of letters and points are adapted to the language\n- Supports offline play\n\nLanguages and dictionaries supported:\n   - English (SOWPODS 2025 + NWL 2023)\n   - French\n   - German (with support of Umlauts, and Ezset to be replaced by two 'S')\n   - Italian\n   - Spanish\n   - Dutch",

        "description": "Classic Words is the best word game to play against your iPhone or iPad (solitaire mode). Scrabble for victory and enrich your vocabulary thanks to the built-in word definitions!\n6 languages are supported: English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Dutch.\n\nTired of stumbling across cheaters or waiting for hours for your online opponent to play in multiplayer games?\nTry out Classic Words for instant fun, no matter if you are a beginner in crossword games or a tournament player!\n\nChoose the difficulty level (from beginner to expert), pick a word list, and use your strategy skills and vocabulary to try and defeat the iPhone. The English word lists included in the game are inspired by the official lists used in Scrabble tournaments: NWL and SOWPODS.\n\nClassic Words gameplay is classical to crosswords board games: create and place words on the board and boost your score by placing letters on the high-scoring Double Letter, Double Word, Triple Letter, and Triple Word squares.\nUse all 7 letters from your rack to play a Bingo and get a 50-point bonus.\n\nThis game is a great time killer for all fans of board games and strategy games. It is also an educational game that will allow kids (and adults :-) ) to improve their spelling and vocabulary. \n\nThanks to the fast reactivity of the artificial intelligence (AI) and to the official word lists, Classic Words can be used by traditional word game enthusiasts to play quick training matches and learn new words from the computer's moves.\n\nUnlike with multiplayer board games, where some dishonest players use anagram solvers, there is no cheating possible when playing in solitaire... Letters and blanks are always picked randomly, and the computer's artificial intelligence does not have more information than you do.\n\nOnly your tactics and creativity can make the difference...\nWill you play strategically enough to outwit the computer and its extensive vocabulary?\n\nEXCLUSIVE FEATURES:\n- 6 levels of difficulty\n- Automatic display of the definition of the iPhone words\n- Distribution of letters and points are adapted to the language\n- Supports offline play\n\nLanguages and dictionaries supported:\n   - English (SOWPODS 2025 + NWL 2023)\n   - French\n   - German (with support of Umlauts, and Ezset to be replaced by two 'S')\n   - Italian\n   - Spanish\n   - Dutch",

These small, loose sketches in greyscale help you understand where shadows fall and highlights appear—essential for capturing depth and form.\n\nValue Study is a simple, focused tool designed to help you see values more clearly in your reference images. Instead of just converting a photo to black and white, this app lets you break down tones step by step. Start with just black and white to map out the biggest shapes, then gradually add more values to refine your understanding.\n\nYou can also highlight all areas of an image that share the same value, making it easier to see subtle shifts in tone. This is especially useful in complex references, like portraits, where different parts of the image might have the same level of shadow but look completely different in colour.\n\nValue Study isn’t here to replace traditional studies—it’s here to enhance them. Whether you're sketching, painting, or working digitally, this tool makes it easier to focus on the fundamentals of light, shadow, and form.\n\nTry it for free with all features enabled on sample images from Unsplash before deciding to unlock the full app with a low-cost yearly or lifetime purchase.

      "description": "Get your scofield Bible or scofield reference Bible for with King James Bible text. A student of the word needs to have references to other commentaries so they can learn the word of God well.\n\nAs a Bible is it important to have a Bible commentary which gives you an understanding of certain scriptures. The Bible commentary is not supposed to replace our communion with the Holy Spirit. This is as a help but the Holy Spirit is our ultimate helper. Written originally in 1909, C. I. Scofield's intent was to provide a concise but complete tool that would meet the need of someone just beginning to read the Bible and it has helped a lot of people to understand the Bible very well. \n\nThe Scofield Reference Bible contains very brief commentary, often consisting of no more than a few sentences and several cross-references. Usually the definitions are short which makes it easy to memorize. The good thing about this Scofield reference Bible is that it is completely offline and can be used when you are on the go. This is Bible in your pocket reference Bible. \n\nThe Scofield Study Bible had several innovative features. Most important, it printed what amounted to a commentary on the biblical text alongside the Bible instead of in a separate volume. This Scofield Bible has embedded in it King James Bible which you can move in between screens easily whiles doing your reference Bible study.\n\nThe King James Bible that comes with it has daily Bible verses which shows on your phone daily. It also has audio that you can download and listen to offline as you choose. Do you have a scripture in mind that you want to bookmark or save as a favorite? Then this can be done as well. \n\nGone are the days when you have a King James Bible and then you have a highlighter that you use to highlight different words. This is also possible in this application. You have the option to choose several colors and to use them to make a remarkable Bible interface to save the best things God has taught you whiles reading the Bible.\n\nThe Scofield reference Bible contains a cross-referencing system that tied together related verses of Scripture and allowed a reader to follow biblical themes from one chapter and book to another. \n\nIt was in the pages of the Scofield Reference Bible that many Christians first encountered Archbishop James Ussher's calculation of the date of Creation as 4004 BC; and through discussion of Scofield's notes, which advocated the \"gap theory,\" fundamentalists began a serious internal debate about the nature and chronology of creation.\n\nThere is so much good news in the word of God. God enjoys it when His children read His word and are obedient to it in all things. We give Him all the praise for all the things He has done.\n\nGet daily Bible verses\nIn this scofield Bible reference you also get daily Bible verses for your daily motivation. The goodness of God will never cease and with our daily Bible reading, we are able to have the best of things we need.\n\nBookmark feature of scofield reference Bible or scofield offline Bible\nEvery verse you like can be bookmarked in the KJV Bible offline section for quick reference.\n\nScofield reference is a must have Bible app for the Bible believing Christian. When referring to the reference it helps. There is audio Bible on the other side of this reference which helps those who cannot read so well to listen to the Bible in style.",

        "description": "Get your scofield Bible or scofield reference Bible for with King James Bible text. A student of the word needs to have references to other commentaries so they can learn the word of God well.\n\nAs a Bible is it important to have a Bible commentary which gives you an understanding of certain scriptures. The Bible commentary is not supposed to replace our communion with the Holy Spirit. This is as a help but the Holy Spirit is our ultimate helper. Written originally in 1909, C. I. Scofield's intent was to provide a concise but complete tool that would meet the need of someone just beginning to read the Bible and it has helped a lot of people to understand the Bible very well. \n\nThe Scofield Reference Bible contains very brief commentary, often consisting of no more than a few sentences and several cross-references. Usually the definitions are short which makes it easy to memorize. The good thing about this Scofield reference Bible is that it is completely offline and can be used when you are on the go. This is Bible in your pocket reference Bible. \n\nThe Scofield Study Bible had several innovative features. Most important, it printed what amounted to a commentary on the biblical text alongside the Bible instead of in a separate volume. This Scofield Bible has embedded in it King James Bible which you can move in between screens easily whiles doing your reference Bible study.\n\nThe King James Bible that comes with it has daily Bible verses which shows on your phone daily. It also has audio that you can download and listen to offline as you choose. Do you have a scripture in mind that you want to bookmark or save as a favorite? Then this can be done as well. \n\nGone are the days when you have a King James Bible and then you have a highlighter that you use to highlight different words. This is also possible in this application. You have the option to choose several colors and to use them to make a remarkable Bible interface to save the best things God has taught you whiles reading the Bible.\n\nThe Scofield reference Bible contains a cross-referencing system that tied together related verses of Scripture and allowed a reader to follow biblical themes from one chapter and book to another. \n\nIt was in the pages of the Scofield Reference Bible that many Christians first encountered Archbishop James Ussher's calculation of the date of Creation as 4004 BC; and through discussion of Scofield's notes, which advocated the \"gap theory,\" fundamentalists began a serious internal debate about the nature and chronology of creation.\n\nThere is so much good news in the word of God. God enjoys it when His children read His word and are obedient to it in all things. We give Him all the praise for all the things He has done.\n\nGet daily Bible verses\nIn this scofield Bible reference you also get daily Bible verses for your daily motivation. The goodness of God will never cease and with our daily Bible reading, we are able to have the best of things we need.\n\nBookmark feature of scofield reference Bible or scofield offline Bible\nEvery verse you like can be bookmarked in the KJV Bible offline section for quick reference.\n\nScofield reference is a must have Bible app for the Bible believing Christian. When referring to the reference it helps. There is audio Bible on the other side of this reference which helps those who cannot read so well to listen to the Bible in style.",

      "description": "Get instant, offline access to high-yield microbiology facts designed specifically for medical students during the pre-clerkship, step 1, and clerkship periods. Traditional educational tools flood learners with the infamous \"fire hose\" of information with little direction for which information is most critical for the boards and the wards. Students instead cram for exams and rely on question banks and seemingly endless \"pimping\" sessions in the hospital to begin building a mental framework. These methods are effective but represent a reactive learning strategy with clear room for improvement. With this in mind, a team of medical students at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences worked with the Microbiology and IT departments to create μBio, a medical microbiology reference application built specifically for medical students.\n\nApp Highlights\nContent: Key testable information related to medically-relevant bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Content is continually re-evaluated and updated for accuracy, utility, and simplicity.\nAccess: Data is stored on your device for instant, offline access (important in the hospital setting with limited connectivity). Data updates and external resources are available on demand when connected to the web.\nBuild Foundation: Content is intentionally light-weight and consists of only the most relevant information. This is meant to lower the barrier for material review and encourage repetition throughout the day, rather than cramming before the exam.\nExpand Knowledge: Key facts link to additional detail (diagrams, articles, etc.) while connected to the internet to allow for deeper learning in academic settings.\nSearch by Anything: When you come across a bug in the classroom or the hospital, instantly access high-yield information by typing all or part of the the name, transmission, morphology, treatment, any more.\n\nFeedback: We are constantly looking to improve both the functionality of the app and the quality of the data. Use the bug-specific feedback (bug-specific pages, top-right menu) for specific content feedback as well as the general feedback form (main page, top-right menu) for general feedback.\n\nAnalytics: As of v2.0, we use Google Analytics (Firebase) to collect basic information about app interaction to help make future improvements to the platform. We do NOT collect personal or identifiable information, such as your name or age. For more information about what information is specifically collected, please use the in-app general feedback form and be sure to leave your email address so that we can get back to you.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended to be a reference for medical students. Do not make medical decisions based on the content found within this app. Consult a doctor for medical advice.",

        "description": "Get instant, offline access to high-yield microbiology facts designed specifically for medical students during the pre-clerkship, step 1, and clerkship periods. Traditional educational tools flood learners with the infamous \"fire hose\" of information with little direction for which information is most critical for the boards and the wards. Students instead cram for exams and rely on question banks and seemingly endless \"pimping\" sessions in the hospital to begin building a mental framework. These methods are effective but represent a reactive learning strategy with clear room for improvement. With this in mind, a team of medical students at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences worked with the Microbiology and IT departments to create μBio, a medical microbiology reference application built specifically for medical students.\n\nApp Highlights\nContent: Key testable information related to medically-relevant bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Content is continually re-evaluated and updated for accuracy, utility, and simplicity.\nAccess: Data is stored on your device for instant, offline access (important in the hospital setting with limited connectivity). Data updates and external resources are available on demand when connected to the web.\nBuild Foundation: Content is intentionally light-weight and consists of only the most relevant information. This is meant to lower the barrier for material review and encourage repetition throughout the day, rather than cramming before the exam.\nExpand Knowledge: Key facts link to additional detail (diagrams, articles, etc.) while connected to the internet to allow for deeper learning in academic settings.\nSearch by Anything: When you come across a bug in the classroom or the hospital, instantly access high-yield information by typing all or part of the the name, transmission, morphology, treatment, any more.\n\nFeedback: We are constantly looking to improve both the functionality of the app and the quality of the data. Use the bug-specific feedback (bug-specific pages, top-right menu) for specific content feedback as well as the general feedback form (main page, top-right menu) for general feedback.\n\nAnalytics: As of v2.0, we use Google Analytics (Firebase) to collect basic information about app interaction to help make future improvements to the platform. We do NOT collect personal or identifiable information, such as your name or age. For more information about what information is specifically collected, please use the in-app general feedback form and be sure to leave your email address so that we can get back to you.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended to be a reference for medical students. Do not make medical decisions based on the content found within this app. Consult a doctor for medical advice.",

      "description": "The Scofield Reference Bible Commentary is a widely circulated study Bible edited and annotated by the American Bible student Cyrus I. Scofield, which popularized dispensationalism at the beginning of the 20th century. Published by Oxford University Press and containing the entire text of the traditional, Protestant King James Version, it first appeared in 1909 and was revised by the author in 1917\n\nThe Scofield Reference Bible  had several innovative features. Most important, it printed what amounted to a commentary on the biblical text alongside the Bible instead of in a separate volume, the first to do so since the Geneva Bible (1560). It also contained a cross-referencing system that tied together related verses of Scripture and allowed a reader to follow biblical themes from one chapter and book to another (so called \"chain references\"). Finally, the 1917 edition also attempted to date events of the Bible. It was in the pages of the Scofield Reference Bible that many Christians first encountered Archbishop James Ussher's calculation of the date of Creation as 4004 BC; and through discussion of Scofield's notes, which advocated the \"gap theory,\" fundamentalists began a serious internal debate about the nature and chronology of creation.\n\nThe Scofield Bible was published only a few years before World War I, a war that destroyed the cultural optimism that had viewed the world as entering a new era of peace and prosperity; then the post-World War II era witnessed the creation in Israel of a homeland for the Jews. Thus, Scofield's premillennialism seemed prophetic. \"At the popular level, especially, many people came to regard the dispensationalist scheme as completely vindicated.\" Sales of the Reference Bible exceeded two million copies by the end of World War II. The Scofield Reference Bible promoted dispensationalism, the belief that between creation and the final judgment there would be seven distinct eras of God's dealing with man and that these eras are a framework for synthesizing the message of the Bible. It was largely through the influence of Scofield's notes that dispensationalism grew in influence among fundamentalist Christians in the United States. Scofield's notes on the Book of Revelation are a major source for the various timetables, judgments, and plagues elaborated on by popular religious writers such as Hal Lindsey, Edgar C. Whisenant, and Tim LaHaye; and in part because of the success of the Scofield Reference Bible, twentieth-century American fundamentalists placed greater stress on eschatological speculation. Opponents of biblical fundamentalism have criticized the Scofield Bible for its air of total authority in biblical interpretation, for what they consider its glossing over of biblical contradictions, and for its focus on eschatology.\n\nThe 1917 Scofield Reference Bible notes are now in the public domain, and the Bible is \"consistently the best selling edition of the Scofield Bible\" in the United Kingdom and Ireland.In 1967, Oxford University Press published a revision of the Scofield Bible with a slightly modernized KJV text, and a muting of some of the tenets of Scofield's theology. Recent editions of the KJV Scofield Study Bible have moved the textual changes made in 1967 to the margin. The Press continues to issue editions under the title Oxford Scofield Study Bible, and there are translations into French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese\n\nFeature of Scofield Reference Bible Notes app\n1.

      "description": "An Official US Navy mobile application, produced by the Navy PMW 240 Program and NETC.\n\nThe US Navy Ratings & Reference app provides a fun, easy way to learn Navy ratings. As most service members know, learning how to recognize ratings is an integral part of any Navy career.\nAfter more than 200 years of evolution, today’s Navy enlisted rating structure still plays a key role in career development and serves as a basis for training, detailing, and advancement. US Navy ratings are general enlisted occupations that consist of specific skills and abilities. Each rating has its own specialty badge, which is worn on the left sleeve of the uniform by each enlisted person in that particular field. Working uniforms, such as camouflage Battle Dress Uniforms, utilities, coveralls, and Naval Working \nUniforms, bear generic rate designators that exclude the rating symbol.  \n\nPart of the e-Sailor series of mobile apps, the US Navy Ratings & Reference app uses a short game scenario for quick and enhanced learning. The game randomly generates multiple-choice questions and illustrates ratings options associated with Navy occupations, providing points for each correct answer. The game becomes progressively more complex at higher levels. However, if a player answers incorrectly, the app shows them the correct answer in order to reinforce learning.\n\nA timing element in the game awards additional points for timely correct answers. By selecting the correct answer before the timer runs out, a user earns bonus points. However, there’s no stress here – a user only plays against the app.  \n\nThe US Navy Ratings & Reference app also includes a sortable reference area to review all 56 Navy ratings. This includes Aviation, Construction, Medical, Administration, and Engineering, among others. The app is a great visual tool for learning Navy ratings and can be revisited frequently by anyone desiring refresher training.  \nThe e-Sailor initiative was instituted by the Master Chief Petty Office of the Navy. e-Sailor leverages state-of-the-art mobile technologies to transform training and enhance curriculum delivery methodologies at Recruit Training Command. The e-Sailor series of mobile apps is being developed to support this effort. The goal of e-Sailor is to increase the quality of work and quality of life for the 21st Century Sailor!",

        "description": "An Official US Navy mobile application, produced by the Navy PMW 240 Program and NETC.\n\nThe US Navy Ratings & Reference app provides a fun, easy way to learn Navy ratings. As most service members know, learning how to recognize ratings is an integral part of any Navy career.\nAfter more than 200 years of evolution, today’s Navy enlisted rating structure still plays a key role in career development and serves as a basis for training, detailing, and advancement. US Navy ratings are general enlisted occupations that consist of specific skills and abilities. Each rating has its own specialty badge, which is worn on the left sleeve of the uniform by each enlisted person in that particular field. Working uniforms, such as camouflage Battle Dress Uniforms, utilities, coveralls, and Naval Working \nUniforms, bear generic rate designators that exclude the rating symbol.  \n\nPart of the e-Sailor series of mobile apps, the US Navy Ratings & Reference app uses a short game scenario for quick and enhanced learning. The game randomly generates multiple-choice questions and illustrates ratings options associated with Navy occupations, providing points for each correct answer. The game becomes progressively more complex at higher levels. However, if a player answers incorrectly, the app shows them the correct answer in order to reinforce learning.\n\nA timing element in the game awards additional points for timely correct answers. By selecting the correct answer before the timer runs out, a user earns bonus points. However, there’s no stress here – a user only plays against the app.  \n\nThe US Navy Ratings & Reference app also includes a sortable reference area to review all 56 Navy ratings. This includes Aviation, Construction, Medical, Administration, and Engineering, among others. The app is a great visual tool for learning Navy ratings and can be revisited frequently by anyone desiring refresher training.  \nThe e-Sailor initiative was instituted by the Master Chief Petty Office of the Navy. e-Sailor leverages state-of-the-art mobile technologies to transform training and enhance curriculum delivery methodologies at Recruit Training Command. The e-Sailor series of mobile apps is being developed to support this effort. The goal of e-Sailor is to increase the quality of work and quality of life for the 21st Century Sailor!",

      "description": "** The #1 Prayer App & #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Christian prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Traditional Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the Pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our Pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Pray like a Champion today: Athlete Prayers\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of 50+ guides\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$9.99 per month\n$69.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy",

        "description": "** The #1 Prayer App & #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Christian prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 10,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Traditional Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the Pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our Pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Pray like a Champion today: Athlete Prayers\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of 50+ guides\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$9.99 per month\n$69.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy",

      "description": "Pleco is the ultimate Chinese learning companion: an integrated dictionary / document reader / flashcard system with fullscreen handwriting input and live OCR, from a company that's been making the world's best mobile Chinese learning apps since 2001.\n\nMajor features: ($ = paid add-on)\n\n• Amazing dictionaries. We offer two free built-in dictionaries: the popular open-source CC-CEDICT, with over 110,000 frequently-updated entries, and our own PLC dictionary, with 125,000 entries, parts of speech, and over 25,000 example sentences (with Pinyin). More than two dozen other dictionaries are available as free and paid ($) add-ons, including licensed titles from well-known publishers like Oxford, Longman, FLTRP, Tuttle, SLPH, and Commercial Press.\n\n• Powerful merged search: look up words by Chinese characters, Pinyin (spaces / tones optional), or English, with support for wildcards and full-text search. And no need to tediously flip between all of those dictionaries to find a word - just type in your search term and instantly get a combined, frequency-sorted result list.\n\n• Links and cross-references: easily look up character components, break down words into individual characters, look up lists of words containing a particular character, and search across all dictionaries for example sentences containing a word.\n\n• Gorgeous typography: see it for yourself in our screenshots - we think we're one of the best-looking Chinese dictionaries around. Alternate Kai/Song/Xing-style Chinese fonts are also available ($).\n\n• PRC/HK/Taiwan-friendly: every part of Pleco supports both traditional and simplified, headword readings can be shown in Pinyin and Zhuyin, and some dictionaries even support Cantonese. (note: stroke order diagrams do support traditional characters, but use PRC order)\n\n• Audio: Hear Mandarin and Cantonese for words and example sentences using iOS' free built-in text-to-speech system. We also offer add-ons ($) with native-speaker Mandarin recordings and higher-quality Mandarin TTS.\n\n• Document Reader: bring in text from the clipboard and tap on words in it to instantly look them up. Upgrade ($) adds support for tap-lookups in text, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and EPUB files. We also offer graded readings ($).\n\n• OCR: look up words simply by pointing your device's camera at them, or by tapping on them in a still image. ($)\n\n• Fullscreen handwriting: use your device's whole screen instead of just a little box. Extremely accurate and highly tolerant of stroke order mistakes. (enhanced $)\n\n• Flashcards: create a card from any dictionary entry with a single button tap, import premade word lists, use advanced memorization techniques like SRS, and study in a variety of modes including fill-in-the-blanks handwriting and tone drills. ($)\n\n• Stroke Order Diagrams: animations showing you how to draw each character; 500 characters for free, 28,000 in paid ($) version.\n\n• User dictionaries: create new dictionary entries right on your device as you encounter new words. ($)\n\n• No ads.\n\nWe also offer famously excellent customer support and an active user community at http://www.plecoforums.com. And we're constantly working to make our products better; our sales and customer base have been growing for two decades across 4 different platforms. You can be confident that we'll still be fixing bugs and adding features for years to come.\n\nPaid add-ons can be transferred to other devices that link to your iTunes account just like any other paid iTunes content; simply install our free app, open up the \"Add-ons\" screen, and tap on the \"Restore Purchases\" button to activate your purchase on each device.\n\nPlease contact us at support@pleco.com, via the form at http://www.pleco.com/contact.html, or using the in-app \"Contact Support\" command with any questions - we'll be delighted to hear from you.",

        "description": "Pleco is the ultimate Chinese learning companion: an integrated dictionary / document reader / flashcard system with fullscreen handwriting input and live OCR, from a company that's been making the world's best mobile Chinese learning apps since 2001.\n\nMajor features: ($ = paid add-on)\n\n• Amazing dictionaries. We offer two free built-in dictionaries: the popular open-source CC-CEDICT, with over 110,000 frequently-updated entries, and our own PLC dictionary, with 125,000 entries, parts of speech, and over 25,000 example sentences (with Pinyin). More than two dozen other dictionaries are available as free and paid ($) add-ons, including licensed titles from well-known publishers like Oxford, Longman, FLTRP, Tuttle, SLPH, and Commercial Press.\n\n• Powerful merged search: look up words by Chinese characters, Pinyin (spaces / tones optional), or English, with support for wildcards and full-text search. And no need to tediously flip between all of those dictionaries to find a word - just type in your search term and instantly get a combined, frequency-sorted result list.\n\n• Links and cross-references: easily look up character components, break down words into individual characters, look up lists of words containing a particular character, and search across all dictionaries for example sentences containing a word.\n\n• Gorgeous typography: see it for yourself in our screenshots - we think we're one of the best-looking Chinese dictionaries around. Alternate Kai/Song/Xing-style Chinese fonts are also available ($).\n\n• PRC/HK/Taiwan-friendly: every part of Pleco supports both traditional and simplified, headword readings can be shown in Pinyin and Zhuyin, and some dictionaries even support Cantonese. (note: stroke order diagrams do support traditional characters, but use PRC order)\n\n• Audio: Hear Mandarin and Cantonese for words and example sentences using iOS' free built-in text-to-speech system. We also offer add-ons ($) with native-speaker Mandarin recordings and higher-quality Mandarin TTS.\n\n• Document Reader: bring in text from the clipboard and tap on words in it to instantly look them up. Upgrade ($) adds support for tap-lookups in text, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and EPUB files. We also offer graded readings ($).\n\n• OCR: look up words simply by pointing your device's camera at them, or by tapping on them in a still image. ($)\n\n• Fullscreen handwriting: use your device's whole screen instead of just a little box. Extremely accurate and highly tolerant of stroke order mistakes. (enhanced $)\n\n• Flashcards: create a card from any dictionary entry with a single button tap, import premade word lists, use advanced memorization techniques like SRS, and study in a variety of modes including fill-in-the-blanks handwriting and tone drills. ($)\n\n• Stroke Order Diagrams: animations showing you how to draw each character; 500 characters for free, 28,000 in paid ($) version.\n\n• User dictionaries: create new dictionary entries right on your device as you encounter new words. ($)\n\n• No ads.\n\nWe also offer famously excellent customer support and an active user community at http://www.plecoforums.com. And we're constantly working to make our products better; our sales and customer base have been growing for two decades across 4 different platforms. You can be confident that we'll still be fixing bugs and adding features for years to come.\n\nPaid add-ons can be transferred to other devices that link to your iTunes account just like any other paid iTunes content; simply install our free app, open up the \"Add-ons\" screen, and tap on the \"Restore Purchases\" button to activate your purchase on each device.\n\nPlease contact us at support@pleco.com, via the form at http://www.pleco.com/contact.html, or using the in-app \"Contact Support\" command with any questions - we'll be delighted to hear from you.",

      "description": "The ultimate knitting pocket reference guide. Need to remember how to do a certain decrease? Forgot how to do the Kitchener stitch or need a refresher on crossing? We've got you covered!\n\nThe ever popular KnittingHelp.com knitting videos are now available for the iPhone. Includes 170 knitting videos from the website have been organized and added to this knitting video reference app. The videos are stored within the app and not streamed, so there is no need for an Internet connection to watch them. This means you can access the videos instantly from anywhere. On an airplane? Not a problem. You will have at your fingertips access to numerous cast-on methods, bind-offs, increases and decreases, stitch patterns and a whole lot more. If you want to know if a particular subject is covered, I'd recommend going to http://www.knittinghelp.com. \n\nOver 170 Knitting Videos in 15 Categories::\n\n* Getting Started \n* Cast-On  \n* Knit\n* Purl\n* Fixing Mistakes \n* Stitch Patterns\n* Bind Off\n* Increases  \n* Decreases\n* Joining Yarn \n* Knitting in the Round\n* Color Knitting\n* Advanced Techniques\n* Finishing/Seaming \n* Miscellaneous \n\nThis app does not include the premium videos from the website or the the 45 minute \"How to Knit: A Complete Introduction.\" beginner series. But all the other free videos from the website are included in this app for quick access. \n\nAlso Amy Finlay has included an introduction section to help new knitters get up to speed. The introduction covers topics such as choosing a first project, selecting yarn and needles, casting on, knit and purl stitches, gauge, and more.\n\nNOTE: Just like on the website, some of the smaller videos do not have sound and are meant to be followed visually. These are typically simpler videos such as increases and decreases and are very easy to discern by watching.",

We've got you covered!\n\nThe ever popular KnittingHelp.com knitting videos are now available for the iPhone. Includes 170 knitting videos from the website have been organized and added to this knitting video reference app. The videos are stored within the app and not streamed, so there is no need for an Internet connection to watch them. This means you can access the videos instantly from anywhere. On an airplane? Not a problem. You will have at your fingertips access to numerous cast-on methods, bind-offs, increases and decreases, stitch patterns and a whole lot more. If you want to know if a particular subject is covered, I'd recommend going to http://www.knittinghelp.com. \n\nOver 170 Knitting Videos in 15 Categories::\n\n* Getting Started \n* Cast-On  \n* Knit\n* Purl\n* Fixing Mistakes \n* Stitch Patterns\n* Bind Off\n* Increases  \n* Decreases\n* Joining Yarn \n* Knitting in the Round\n* Color Knitting\n* Advanced Techniques\n* Finishing/Seaming \n* Miscellaneous \n\nThis app does not include the premium videos from the website or the the 45 minute \"How to Knit: A Complete Introduction.\" beginner series. But all the other free videos from the website are included in this app for quick access. \n\nAlso Amy Finlay has included an introduction section to help new knitters get up to speed. The introduction covers topics such as choosing a first project, selecting yarn and needles, casting on, knit and purl stitches, gauge, and more.\n\nNOTE: Just like on the website, some of the smaller videos do not have sound and are meant to be followed visually. These are typically simpler videos such as increases and decreases and are very easy to discern by watching.",

The app draws the complete code database directly from the data files available at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nICD10 Consult also provides full searchable and browsable access to the old ICD9-CM codes which were in use until October 1, 2015.\n\nICD10 Consult is ad supported to provide you with the current, up-to-date codes.

      "description": "An Official US Navy mobile application, produced by the Navy PMW 240 Program and NETC\n\nThe US Military Rank & Reference app provides a fun, easy way to learn Military ranks and insignia across all branches of the Military.  As most service members know, learning how to recognize who to salute and address properly by rank or uniform insignia is an integral part of any Military career.\nPart of the e-Sailor series of mobile apps, US Military Rank & Reference uses a short game scenario for quick and enhanced learning.  The game randomly generates elements associated with Military rank, including collar devices, insignia on sleeves, and shoulder boards.  The game provides multiple-choice visual selections and provides points for each correct answer. If a player answers incorrectly, the app shows them the correct insignia to reinforce learning. \n\nA timing element in the game awards additional points for timely correct answers. By selecting the correct answer before the timer runs out, a user earns bonus points. However, there’s no stress here – a user only plays against the app. You begin with Navy ranks from 0-4,999 points. This progresses to Navy/Marine at 5,000-8,999 points and, at the highest level, Navy/Marine, Air Force, and Army at 9,000+ points. The user can see and identify all ranks across the Navy – from basic training when they are a Seaman to Chief Petty Officer to ranks of senior Admirals. Or they can switch their setting to the Marine Corps and view and identify ranks from Private to Gunnery Sergeant to General.  Army and Air Force ranks and insignia are also included in the app.  \nThe US Military Rank & Reference app also includes a sortable reference area to review full sets of cross-service rank indicators for a variety of Military personnel: Enlisted, Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO), and Officers. The app is a great visual tool for learning Military ranks and can be revisited frequently by anyone desiring refresher training.  \n\nThe e-Sailor initiative was instituted by the Master Chief Petty Office of the Navy.  e-Sailor leverages state-of-the-art mobile technologies to transform training and enhance curriculum delivery methodologies at Recruit Training Command. The e-Sailor series of mobile apps is being developed to support this effort.  The goal of e-Sailor is to increase the quality of work and quality of life for the 21st Century Sailor!",

        "description": "An Official US Navy mobile application, produced by the Navy PMW 240 Program and NETC\n\nThe US Military Rank & Reference app provides a fun, easy way to learn Military ranks and insignia across all branches of the Military.  As most service members know, learning how to recognize who to salute and address properly by rank or uniform insignia is an integral part of any Military career.\nPart of the e-Sailor series of mobile apps, US Military Rank & Reference uses a short game scenario for quick and enhanced learning.  The game randomly generates elements associated with Military rank, including collar devices, insignia on sleeves, and shoulder boards.  The game provides multiple-choice visual selections and provides points for each correct answer. If a player answers incorrectly, the app shows them the correct insignia to reinforce learning. \n\nA timing element in the game awards additional points for timely correct answers. By selecting the correct answer before the timer runs out, a user earns bonus points. However, there’s no stress here – a user only plays against the app. You begin with Navy ranks from 0-4,999 points. This progresses to Navy/Marine at 5,000-8,999 points and, at the highest level, Navy/Marine, Air Force, and Army at 9,000+ points. The user can see and identify all ranks across the Navy – from basic training when they are a Seaman to Chief Petty Officer to ranks of senior Admirals. Or they can switch their setting to the Marine Corps and view and identify ranks from Private to Gunnery Sergeant to General.  Army and Air Force ranks and insignia are also included in the app.  \nThe US Military Rank & Reference app also includes a sortable reference area to review full sets of cross-service rank indicators for a variety of Military personnel: Enlisted, Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO), and Officers. The app is a great visual tool for learning Military ranks and can be revisited frequently by anyone desiring refresher training.  \n\nThe e-Sailor initiative was instituted by the Master Chief Petty Office of the Navy.  e-Sailor leverages state-of-the-art mobile technologies to transform training and enhance curriculum delivery methodologies at Recruit Training Command. The e-Sailor series of mobile apps is being developed to support this effort.  The goal of e-Sailor is to increase the quality of work and quality of life for the 21st Century Sailor!",
