      "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nWhen it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how:\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.\n\nPRESS\n\"It's the go-to dating app for many people looking for love.\" - The Daily Mail\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only.",

      "description": "Boo is for connecting with compatible and like-minded souls.

We use personality psychology to help you find dates and friends that'll effortlessly love, appreciate, and understand you for who you naturally are.\n\nFind your soulmate or your best friend.\n\nOUR FEATURES\n\n1. SOCIAL DATING + FRIEND-FINDING \nPost in interest communities and meet new people by shared values and interests. Chat casually with people on funny, interesting, and insightful topics.\n\n2. FLIRTING TIPS\nGet in-depth dating tips and personality analysis with cutting-edge personality psychology. \n\nUnderstand anyone’s\n1. Compatibility\n2. Strengths\n3. Weaknesses\n4. Attracted By\n5.

AUTHENTICITY\nBe yourself. That’s the only way you’ll attract the right people. Embracing your authentic self starts when you realize that every personality has its flaws, that there are others who share your same personality, and that you are not alone. \n\n3. TRANSPARENCY\nUnderstand yourself and others like never before in human history. Understand anyone deeply instantly, not 3 weeks, months, or years into a failed relationship. \n\n4. EMPOWERMENT\nAttraction, compatibility, and succeeding in dating and making friends have always been a black box. With personality insight, you are empowered to understand how it all works for yourself, make the right decisions, and set yourself up for success.\n\nWe were using all the dating apps. It was always the same result–going on dates with people we had no chemistry with. We were exhausted from all the wasted time and effort. We made Boo because we knew there was a better way.\n\nOur mission is to create a future in which personality enables our greatest potential, starting with our relationships.\n\nWe hope you like it,\nThe souls at Boo\n\nhttps://boo.world/terms-and-conditions",

EMPOWERMENT\nAttraction, compatibility, and succeeding in dating and making friends have always been a black box. With personality insight, you are empowered to understand how it all works for yourself, make the right decisions, and set yourself up for success.\n\nWe were using all the dating apps. It was always the same result–going on dates with people we had no chemistry with. We were exhausted from all the wasted time and effort. We made Boo because we knew there was a better way.\n\nOur mission is to create a future in which personality enables our greatest potential, starting with our relationships.\n\nWe hope you like it,\nThe souls at Boo\n\nhttps://boo.world/terms-and-conditions",

That’s why we’ve created our unique Compatibility Matching System to ensure each of your matches are based on qualities that are important to you. Compared to other dating apps, we make finding love simple. We’ll guide you through the process in three easy steps:\n\nSTEP 1: TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF \nYour dating journey on our dating app starts with the Compatibility Quiz. Because we get to know you better so we can match you better. \n\nSTEP 2: LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY \nYour answers to the Compatibility Quiz are compiled to create a Personality Profile, an informative report about your character, lifestyle, relationship behavior and communication style. The results allow eharmony to do the work for you and match you with compatible singles.\n\nSTEP 3: MATCH WITH COMPATIBLE SINGLES \nIt’s finally time to start dating. Through your Discover List you’ll have access on each members' profile so you can better understand who they are as a person. The list is constantly updated as new members join so you’ll never miss an opportunity to fall in love. \n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\nIt’s time to connect with compatible members and meet new people! Try one of our different communication features: Send a smile, start a conversation with an icebreaker or use our similarities cards to explore interesting and character traits you and your match share.\n\neharmony is the #1 Trusted Dating App. We have a skilled in-house Trust and Safety team to ensure our platform is safe, inclusive, and welcoming to every member of our community.\n\nTHE REVIEWS ARE IN\n\"The app serves you connections based on values...\" — (PC Mag UK) \n\"The OG dating site that focuses on lasting relationships through compatibility...\" — (Techcrunch)\n \nFIND THE MEMBERSHIP THAT WORKS FOR YOU  \n\nThe Basic Membership is your default free membership upon joining.

This gives you full access to all of eharmony’s functions and capabilities, making it much easier to find a connect with your ideal partner. \n\nMembership structure – Online dating is a journey and shouldn’t be rushed.

      "description": "High standards? Keep them that way. The League is a selective dating app offering its members a curated “Batch” of potentials each day, rather than an unlimited stream of profiles. Designed for motivated daters who would rather be single than settle, The League strongly believes that 3 quality matches are better than 100 bad ones. So say goodbye to endless swiping and keep those standards sky-high— because while your mother might call you picky, we call you self-aware.\n\n\nThe League uses an application process to ensure a well-balanced, highly engaged community of people with real motivation to find a meaningful long-term relationship. You can use The League for free or upgrade to a subscription to unlock additional benefits. Subscribers see more profiles each day, and thus, enjoy 40% more matches on average.\n\nSubscription Details: Payment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase. \n\nSee our terms of service at https://www.theleague.com/terms-of-service-en/ and and privacy policy at https://www.theleague.com/privacy-policy-en/\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only.",

        "description": "High standards? Keep them that way. The League is a selective dating app offering its members a curated “Batch” of potentials each day, rather than an unlimited stream of profiles. Designed for motivated daters who would rather be single than settle, The League strongly believes that 3 quality matches are better than 100 bad ones. So say goodbye to endless swiping and keep those standards sky-high— because while your mother might call you picky, we call you self-aware.\n\n\nThe League uses an application process to ensure a well-balanced, highly engaged community of people with real motivation to find a meaningful long-term relationship. You can use The League for free or upgrade to a subscription to unlock additional benefits. Subscribers see more profiles each day, and thus, enjoy 40% more matches on average.\n\nSubscription Details: Payment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

      "description": "Holy (formerly United Young) is an app to meet people who love Jesus, made by married couple Kathleen & Jonathan.\n\nThe app lets you connect with an inspiring selection of Christians near you every day.\n\nSee someone you’re interested in? Wave at them. If they wave back, we will connect you both, and you can chat!\n\n• Find a friend within the Christian community.\n• Read why people say Jesus matters.\n• Share your testimony and Bible inspiration.\n• Find inspiration in the faith journey of people near you.\n• Discover people in similar seasons of life.\n\nNote: Christ-honoring dating is only available to those who are single and of age 18 and upward.\n\nWe welcome everyone who confesses Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and considers themselves a Christian (confessing the Nicene Creed) to join! We seek to connect the greater Christian community, and are united in our love for Jesus.\n\nWhether you are Catholic, Nondenominational, Evangelical, Anglican, Baptist, Reformed, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Methodist, or are just at the beginning of your journey with Jesus, you are welcome to join our diverse community of believers!\n\nThis app was inspired by the call to unity (in Ephesians 4 & John 17) and the call to love and encourage one another (in Hebrews 10 & 1 Thessalonians 4). In addition, we were greatly inspired by Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s book “Life Together”. Bonhoeffer beautifully describes how we can see Jesus more clearly in the lives and testimonies of our brothers and sisters.\n\n** Winner of both Jury and People’s Choice Awards at NYC Redeemer Presbyterian’s Center for Faith & Work’s Startup Pitch Night. **\n\nHoly is free to download and use. This is made possible by members who generously subscribe to our Supporter plan. Supporting Holy lets us further the app and its mission, and gives access to extra features.\n\nSupporter benefits include:\n• See all received waves in one place.\n• Go back with 48 hour history.\n• Send priority messages.\n• See when chats are read.\n\nThe price and duration of our Supporter subscriptions are clearly displayed in the app. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nBy downloading or using the Holy app, you kindly agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use:\n\nhttps://www.holy.app/privacy\nhttps://www.holy.app/terms\n\nWe hope you are inspired, and would love to hear from you!\n\n:)\n\nConnected in Christ,\nKathleen & Jonathan\n\nEmail: support@holy.app\nWeb: https://www.holy.app",

        "description": "Holy (formerly United Young) is an app to meet people who love Jesus, made by married couple Kathleen & Jonathan.\n\nThe app lets you connect with an inspiring selection of Christians near you every day.\n\nSee someone you’re interested in? Wave at them. If they wave back, we will connect you both, and you can chat!\n\n• Find a friend within the Christian community.\n• Read why people say Jesus matters.\n• Share your testimony and Bible inspiration.\n• Find inspiration in the faith journey of people near you.\n• Discover people in similar seasons of life.\n\nNote: Christ-honoring dating is only available to those who are single and of age 18 and upward.\n\nWe welcome everyone who confesses Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and considers themselves a Christian (confessing the Nicene Creed) to join! We seek to connect the greater Christian community, and are united in our love for Jesus.\n\nWhether you are Catholic, Nondenominational, Evangelical, Anglican, Baptist, Reformed, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Methodist, or are just at the beginning of your journey with Jesus, you are welcome to join our diverse community of believers!\n\nThis app was inspired by the call to unity (in Ephesians 4 & John 17) and the call to love and encourage one another (in Hebrews 10 & 1 Thessalonians 4). In addition, we were greatly inspired by Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s book “Life Together”. Bonhoeffer beautifully describes how we can see Jesus more clearly in the lives and testimonies of our brothers and sisters.\n\n** Winner of both Jury and People’s Choice Awards at NYC Redeemer Presbyterian’s Center for Faith & Work’s Startup Pitch Night. **\n\nHoly is free to download and use. This is made possible by members who generously subscribe to our Supporter plan. Supporting Holy lets us further the app and its mission, and gives access to extra features.\n\nSupporter benefits include:\n• See all received waves in one place.\n• Go back with 48 hour history.\n• Send priority messages.\n• See when chats are read.\n\nThe price and duration of our Supporter subscriptions are clearly displayed in the app. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nBy downloading or using the Holy app, you kindly agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use:\n\nhttps://www.holy.app/privacy\nhttps://www.holy.app/terms\n\nWe hope you are inspired, and would love to hear from you!\n\n:)\n\nConnected in Christ,\nKathleen & Jonathan\n\nEmail: support@holy.app\nWeb: https://www.holy.app",

      "description": "BlackGentry dating app is a members-only dating app that makes it easier to meet ambitious and intentional singles. BlackGentry is designed to foster a high-quality community where members can meet, match, and build lasting relationships.\n\nEvery profile is reviewed by the membership committee before being accepted. Prospective members can download the app and submit an application. Once submitted, applications are placed on a waitlist and are reviewed by the membership committee. An applicant’s status can change from “waitlisted” to “accepted” at any time. We prioritize detailed, polished profiles with classy photos that reflect effort and profiles that align with our community standards. Acceptance is not guaranteed, and profiles that don’t meet our criteria will not be approved.\n\nOur community values are kindness, respect, integrity and growth. BlackGentry is open to everyone and our mission is to provide an online community that makes it easier for singles to establish healthier connections and relationships. \n\nAll members can chat with their matches for free and also send a limited number of Direct Messages per day. Members can choose to subscribe to Deluxe or VIP to enable more features. Subscription options include 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month plans. Prices are in U.S. dollars, may vary by country, and are subject to change without notice.\n\nSubscriptions will be charged to your Apple account at confirmation of purchase and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your Apple Account settings. Subscriptions will auto-renew unless turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. \n\nSubscriptions are tied to only one BlackGentry account and cannot be used by multiple accounts. \n\nTerms: https://blackgentryapp.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy Policy: https://blackgentryapp.com/privacy-policy-2/\n\nWe will be glad to see all your feedback at contact@blackgentryapp.com",

        "description": "BlackGentry dating app is a members-only dating app that makes it easier to meet ambitious and intentional singles. BlackGentry is designed to foster a high-quality community where members can meet, match, and build lasting relationships.\n\nEvery profile is reviewed by the membership committee before being accepted. Prospective members can download the app and submit an application. Once submitted, applications are placed on a waitlist and are reviewed by the membership committee. An applicant’s status can change from “waitlisted” to “accepted” at any time. We prioritize detailed, polished profiles with classy photos that reflect effort and profiles that align with our community standards. Acceptance is not guaranteed, and profiles that don’t meet our criteria will not be approved.\n\nOur community values are kindness, respect, integrity and growth. BlackGentry is open to everyone and our mission is to provide an online community that makes it easier for singles to establish healthier connections and relationships. \n\nAll members can chat with their matches for free and also send a limited number of Direct Messages per day. Members can choose to subscribe to Deluxe or VIP to enable more features. Subscription options include 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month plans. Prices are in U.S. dollars, may vary by country, and are subject to change without notice.\n\nSubscriptions will be charged to your Apple account at confirmation of purchase and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your Apple Account settings. Subscriptions will auto-renew unless turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable. \n\nSubscriptions are tied to only one BlackGentry account and cannot be used by multiple accounts. \n\nTerms: https://blackgentryapp.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy Policy: https://blackgentryapp.com/privacy-policy-2/\n\nWe will be glad to see all your feedback at contact@blackgentryapp.com",

      "description": "Summer is the dating app for people who actually want to go on dates. Instead of chatting endlessly and never meeting up, on Summer you only have 25 messages per match to make a move or move on.\n\nLimited messages\nWhen you get a new match on Summer, the two of you have 25 messages total to see if you hit it off! Remember…conversations on dating apps shouldn’t last forever, so plan a date before it’s too late.\n\nLocked Chats\nOnce you’re out of messages with a match, the chat will lock. We are serious when we say we want you to actually meet in-person. Summer is for dating, not pen pals!\n\nExplore page\nInstead of forcing you to say yes or no to every profile, Summer shows you a bunch of profiles all at once so you can pick who catches your eye.\n\nNearby\nThe people on your Summer explore page are nearby and recently active. No more worrying about matching with profiles that don’t actively use the app. \n\nWe believe the first date should happen IRL, not over text. Meet your next first date on Summer!",

        "description": "Summer is the dating app for people who actually want to go on dates. Instead of chatting endlessly and never meeting up, on Summer you only have 25 messages per match to make a move or move on.\n\nLimited messages\nWhen you get a new match on Summer, the two of you have 25 messages total to see if you hit it off! Remember…conversations on dating apps shouldn’t last forever, so plan a date before it’s too late.\n\nLocked Chats\nOnce you’re out of messages with a match, the chat will lock. We are serious when we say we want you to actually meet in-person. Summer is for dating, not pen pals!\n\nExplore page\nInstead of forcing you to say yes or no to every profile, Summer shows you a bunch of profiles all at once so you can pick who catches your eye.\n\nNearby\nThe people on your Summer explore page are nearby and recently active. No more worrying about matching with profiles that don’t actively use the app. \n\nWe believe the first date should happen IRL, not over text. Meet your next first date on Summer!",

      "description": "CatholicMatch -- Faith Focused Dating for Catholics\n\nYou want to marry someone who shares your faith. But you’re not finding anyone.\n\nThat’s where we come in. \n\nHelping single Catholics meet is the reason we exist. \n\nOver 1.5 million people have signed up for CatholicMatch, and they’re looking for sacramental marriage. Thanks to our focus on community and faith resources, not only do our members meet other singles for faith-focused dating, but most come away from CatholicMatch with lifelong benefits: an increased knowledge of their faith and new Catholic friends for years to come.\n\nTechnology keeps giving us new ways to connect, and CatholicMatch has been at the forefront of this expansion for the past twenty years. While we’ll never know the exact number, based on what we do know, thousands and likely tens of thousands of sacramental marriages have started on CatholicMatch\n\nExperience Matters\n\nThere are many dating apps out there, and while they may share common features, too many times the experiences are wildly different. We want your dating experience on CatholicMatch to be dependable and useful. So, we place a priority on dating with the goal of sacramental marriage, not just dating to date. Additionally, we try to provide an experience that not only encourages purposeful dating, but also promotes values like respect, charity and compassion. \n\nIn addition, our customer service team is dedicated to accompanying our members in every way possible. They not only provide answers to questions and concerns in a timely manner, they also review all photos and profiles uploaded on the site. Plus, they complement our automated security by manually reviewing questionable accounts and behaviors. Although there is no perfect system, providing a safe and enjoyable experience is one of our top customer service priorities.\n\nSubscription Prices** \n1-month subscription: $29.99 \n6-month subscription: $89.99 \n12-month subscription: $119.99\n\n**Prices are in U.S. dollars, exclude any applicable sales tax, may vary in countries other than the U.S., and are subject to change without notice.\n\nPlease note that with all subscriptions:\n* Your subscription payment will be charged to your iTunes account. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged for renewal 24-hours prior to the end of your current one/six/twelve month subscription period. \n* You can turn off the auto-renewal of your subscription through the App Store on your Apple device or through the iTunes store on your computer. Once you turn off auto-renewal, your subscription will expire at the end of the current subscription period.

        "description": "CatholicMatch -- Faith Focused Dating for Catholics\n\nYou want to marry someone who shares your faith. But you’re not finding anyone.\n\nThat’s where we come in. \n\nHelping single Catholics meet is the reason we exist. \n\nOver 1.5 million people have signed up for CatholicMatch, and they’re looking for sacramental marriage. Thanks to our focus on community and faith resources, not only do our members meet other singles for faith-focused dating, but most come away from CatholicMatch with lifelong benefits: an increased knowledge of their faith and new Catholic friends for years to come.\n\nTechnology keeps giving us new ways to connect, and CatholicMatch has been at the forefront of this expansion for the past twenty years. While we’ll never know the exact number, based on what we do know, thousands and likely tens of thousands of sacramental marriages have started on CatholicMatch\n\nExperience Matters\n\nThere are many dating apps out there, and while they may share common features, too many times the experiences are wildly different. We want your dating experience on CatholicMatch to be dependable and useful. So, we place a priority on dating with the goal of sacramental marriage, not just dating to date. Additionally, we try to provide an experience that not only encourages purposeful dating, but also promotes values like respect, charity and compassion. \n\nIn addition, our customer service team is dedicated to accompanying our members in every way possible. They not only provide answers to questions and concerns in a timely manner, they also review all photos and profiles uploaded on the site. Plus, they complement our automated security by manually reviewing questionable accounts and behaviors. Although there is no perfect system, providing a safe and enjoyable experience is one of our top customer service priorities.\n\nSubscription Prices** \n1-month subscription: $29.99 \n6-month subscription: $89.99 \n12-month subscription: $119.99\n\n**Prices are in U.S. dollars, exclude any applicable sales tax, may vary in countries other than the U.S., and are subject to change without notice.\n\nPlease note that with all subscriptions:\n* Your subscription payment will be charged to your iTunes account. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged for renewal 24-hours prior to the end of your current one/six/twelve month subscription period. \n* You can turn off the auto-renewal of your subscription through the App Store on your Apple device or through the iTunes store on your computer. Once you turn off auto-renewal, your subscription will expire at the end of the current subscription period.

      "description": "It is so much better to date a person who thinks and eats like you. You can share meals in peace and have a good time, knowing that you agree on such important things as saving the animals, protecting the environment and living a healthy lifestyle. Relationships with non-vegetarians tend to always hit some obstacles that we believe can be avoided altogether, if you find the right vegetarian match. Tired of meeting someone in a restaurant and having to explain where you get your proteins from, or why cows and fishes are living beings just like dogs? Or maybe you simply want to meet like minded people to have a happy conversation or exchange vegan recipes. Either way, that's why we created Veggly! Find, match and chat with vegetarians and vegans near you!\n\nHow does Veggly work?\n-Find nearby vegan and vegetarian singles for dating\n-Mark people you liked (or hide the ones you didn’t)\n-Have some real conversations with veggies you matched with using text or audio messages\n- We hope you will meet your veg soul mate or at least some good friends\n\nAlso:\n- Create a profile with your authentic pictures and tell people how long ago you have changed your lifestyle to kickstart a conversation\n- Search based on diet, age, distance or scan through profiles who have been online recently\n- We are open to different types of vegetarians (raw vegan, keto vegetarian etc.) and gender identities\n\nA few testimonials\n- “Our story started when both of us started to scroll through Veggly. Both of us realized that the vegan dating pool is very small and we definitely didn’t expect things to turn out this well. Finding someone who is vegan is great but it obviously takes much more to fall in love and to build a good relationship. From the moment we started talking we realized how many things we have in common and how many shared interests we have.” - Charity and Joe, from Holland and the UK\n- “I’ve never had any good experiences with dating apps before but I decided to give Veggly a try. It stood out from the other apps because it was made for the vegan and vegetarian community. It was a much better experience than I could have imagined. I was pleased to see that I already have at least one core value in common with everyone on the app, which is more than what most apps currently have to offer. I’ve met my boyfriend through Veggly so I have them to thank for giving us the chance to meet, for me to fall so hopelessly and madly in love with him. I would definitely recommend Veggly if you are vegan, vegetarian, or plant based. Everyone needs to eat to live and dating is a much better experience when you can agree on something you need to do every day.” - Victoria, from Canada\n- “I’ve been a member of the app since the early stages, and in fact, recently I met my current partner through the app!  We clicked right away; we chatted and had video dates for about a month. I was traveling across the country in my self-converted van at that time, and for our first date he drove thousands of miles to meet me in Wyoming, then we traveled for about 5 weeks together!  Crazy story but I think that only happened because we met through this app.” - UX Designer, from San Francisco\n- “When I decided to stop eating meat I didn’t know many veg people who I could ask questions to. I decided to download Veggly to chat and look for a veg nutritionist referral (yes, I had that goal hahaha). I ended up meeting a guy who lived 4 blocks from my house, we started talking and we have been together for almost a year now! I never thought I would meet someone nice on a dating app because of my prejudice, but now I’m dating a nice vegan guy!  So the tip of the day is this: download Veggly! Even if you can’t find “the one”, there are plenty of nice people to meet and chat with!” - Chemist, from Brazil\n\nAvailable for premium users\n- Ads-free\n- Monthly Super Likes\n- Teleportation to any city in the world\n- See who liked you\n- Reading confirmation\n\nhttps://www.veggly.net/terms/",
