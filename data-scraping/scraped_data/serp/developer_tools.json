It allows developers, system administrators, and IT professionals to manage servers securely and efficiently, wherever they are. With WebSSH, you can connect to your servers using modern authentication methods including password, two-factor challenge, or keys (RSA, DSA, ED25519, PuTTY). Connections are fast and reliable, with support for local port forwarding, automatic command execution at startup, and full terminal emulation (XTERM-COLOR256, XTERM, VT100). Profiles let you customize themes, colors, fonts, and keyboard behavior to perfectly fit your workflow. Managing files on remote servers is simple thanks to the integrated SFTP client. You can browse directories, create or rename files, upload documents from your device, download files locally, and even edit text files directly within the app. Beyond SSH and SFTP, WebSSH also supports Telnet and Serial connections, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of use cases. Serial connections can be fully configured (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, flow control), while Telnet connections support both direct and interactive authentication. For quick diagnostics, WebSSH includes built-in sysadmin tools such as Ping, Whois, Traceroute, and DNS Lookup. And if you need a terminal even without internet access, the mashREPL feature gives you a local shell with essential commands like ls, grep, curl, ping, tar, and many more. WebSSH supports multiple protocols (SSH, SFTP, Telnet, Serial) and channel types (Shell sessions, SFTP sessions, Local Port Forwarding), ensuring compatibility with most professional scenarios. ____ Why WebSSH? Unlike basic terminal clients, WebSSH combines professional-grade features with a polished, mobile-first design. It is secure, reliable, and easy to use — the all-in-one solution to keep your servers close at hand, no matter where you are. ____ Download WebSSH today and experience secure, seamless server management on iOS and macOS.",

      "description": "Access Git repositories on the go. Clone, edit, commit and push while allowing other apps access to repositories. Git is a important part of our work-life and iOS can take part in this. The ability to commit even when offline has added utility on a device that moves in and out of network coverage. Cloning repositories gets you a local copy on your iOS device with commits for all branches. You can browse the content from within the app and make changes. Other applications supporting the Files app, WebDAV or x-callback-url has access to these files. Changes made can be committed and the commits can in turn be pushed back to the remote. The idea of doing significant programming on iOS might seem far fetched when you are used to a large screen, a physical keyboard and a full IDE. But just as it turned out that not every email is serious prose, then not everything that goes on in Git is significant programming. Sometimes you just want to update a TODO file or make adjustments to your Jekyll site. Sometimes you just need to add a file the designer sent after hours. If you ever make reminders about small things to do with the code-base, then you should give Working Copy a try. You will spend less time moving stuff around and you will get much better commit messages when you write them for fixes that are still fresh in your mind. You won't be leaving your computer behind any time soon, but sometimes it is faster to just fix things with the device in your hand. When you do need to perform real work on iOS, Working Copy is a powerful tool. Editor has syntax highlighting for more than 50 programming languages and a built-in color picker. Preview images, Markdown and HTML files with a Javascript console pointing to errors in your code. Create new branches and merge or rebase them back, with a brilliant merge-tool for handling conflicts. If you need to automate your work there are Working Copy actions in the Shortcuts app for most operations. Even if you never edit a line of code on iOS, Working Copy is a great companion for reviewing and discussing code. Repositories are cross indexed and with powerful fuzzy search you can quickly jump from a symbol to the declaration or reverse from the declaration to all usages. A graph of your commits lets you zoom out for a overview of the commit tree or zoom in for specifics about each commit, with speed and beauty you won’t find in desktop Git applications. Review the changes your files have gone through with a diff viewer that is great for text and images. There is even hex-dump mode for that obscure occasion. Working Copy is a free download but you need to unlock pro features such as the ability to push commits and manage more than 5 repositories. There is no venture capital, large company or ads funding development and your support through in-app purchase directly sustains development. Try out pro features with a 10 day free trial. When you pay to unlock you get permanent access to all pro features at the time of purchase as well as any added the next year. When 12 months have passed you keep all existing pro features but any new ones introduced are locked until you renew your unlock.",

Includes improvements from version 6.5.0 Working Copy is ready for iOS and iPadOS 26. - Enjoy the liquid-glass design with playful animations, while still interacting quickly with repositories. - The new menu bar in iPadOS 26 makes features easier to find and use. - Quickly open files in other apps from the context menu, skipping the share sheet. Configure default apps for file types directly in the Files app. - When inserting files from the clipboard, supported iPhones and iPads can suggest filenames using an on-device language model. - Editor themes now support P3 colors for richer, more vibrant syntax highlighting. - Support for Tcl and Zig syntax modes.",

      "description": "Surge is a web development and proxy utility. It is designed for developers and therefore requires professional knowledge to use. These four capabilities form the core workflow of Surge: · Takeover: You can take over the network connection sent by the device. Surge supports both proxy service and virtual NIC takeover. · Processing: You can modify the network requests and responses that have been taken over. This includes URL redirection, local file mapping, custom modification using JavaScript, and many other methods. · Forwarding: You can forward the taken over network requests to other proxy servers. This can be global forwarding or with a flexible rule system to determine an outbound policy. · Intercept: You can intercept and save specific data of network requests and responses, and you can also decrypt HTTPS traffic with MITM. Highlighted Features · Takeover all HTTP/HTTPS/TCP traffic from any applications on your device, and redirect to an HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5/SOCKS5-TLS/SSH proxy server following highly configurable rules. · Used as a WireGuard Client to convert the L3 VPN as a proxy. · Record and display HTTP requests and responses sent from your iOS devices, including body and header. · Configure rules using domain match, domain suffix, domain keyword, CIDR IP range, and GeoIP lookup. · Measure traffic usage and network speed on WiFi, cellular, and proxy connections. · High performance and suitable for intensive use. · Block ads by domain rules. · Local DNS Map (equivalent to /etc/hosts). You can use this function to switch the production/development environment for your app without changing any code. · All features work on the cellular network. · Decrypt HTTPS traffic with Man-in-the-Middle. · Perform URL rewrite. · Fully IPv6 supports. · Header rewrite. · Raw L3 packets capture. · Safari extension to add rules. · JSON, text, image and video viewer for the captured body. · Album mode for the request list. · Pre-filter for capturing. · HTTPS proxy protocol supports client-side SSL/TLS certificate validation. · Scripting: Use JavaScript to extend the ability of Surge as your wish. · Sync profiles cross devices with iCloud Drive or Dropbox. · DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-HTTP3, DNS-over-QUIC, TLS 1.3 and more advanced features.

Using REST APIs instead of the traditional Git protocol you will be editing files in even the largest repositories in seconds: • Drag a repository URL to the Files app • Browse the directory that immediately appears • Open and Edit files in your favorite app Source Files is file oriented and making edits to 3 different files will result in 3 commits. It is possible to configure the app to work in a branch where a messy commit history is acceptable and merge changes back using pull requests. Consider using traditional Git clients like Working Copy or Tower for projects that need a tidy commit history in all branches. There is rich support for automation with Shortcuts actions to List, Download, Upload and Move files. Uploading files from the Mac services menu and share sheet is supported and very fast as target directories are remembered for different file types. Downloading and Uploading files are pro features. You get a 7 day free trial of all Pro features to explore the benefits after which you can subscribe Monthly or purchase a Lifetime unlock which is shared between iPhone, iPad and Mac.

There are also multiple network utilities: nslookup, ping, whois, ifconfig... Type help for help, help -l to get the full list of commands. a-Shell can be controlled from Shortcuts: run commands in order, process files in a-Shell, get the results as text or files, transfer files to other apps... a-shell uses iOS 13+ “multiple windows” ability, so you can run multiple shells at the same time, with different commands, in different directories. You can edit a file in one window with vim and process it in the other with python. Compile your C or C++ programs to webAssembly using clang or clang++, and execute the resulting binary. A complete webAssembly SDK is included (WASI-libc). a-Shell is the complete version. If you need a smaller app, and you don't need a C compiler, a TeX engine, or numpy and matplotlib, there is a-Shell mini.",

      "description": "Zero-setup Python environment and developer toolbox in a first-class citizen app for iPad and iPhone. Juno is designed to cover all your Python coding needs, and will work seamlessly with all source code formats. Juno supports both Python scripts (.py) and Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) — a document format focused on applying Python to data analysis and computational science. FREE FEATURES - Navigate and manage files and folders, quickly preview documents and media - Browse and view Jupyter notebooks with quick and beautifully rendered previews - Navigate through code sources, scripts, JSON, XML, and other text-based formats with rich previews and syntax highlighting - Add quick access bookmarks for file system locations outside the app's sandbox, or simply open documents in place PRO FEATURES - Run code in Jupyter notebooks and Python sources locally on your device with a built-in Python 3.10 interpreter, entirely offline - Write and execute Python code in a full-fledged development environment, featuring snappy, intelligent code completion and a console with full terminal emulator support - Access all Jupyter features in a modern, powerful and customizable notebook editor - Leverage powerful data analysis, machine learning and developer tools: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, LXML, and more - View and edit any file as text in a built-in versatile plain text editor with syntax highlighting - Enjoy painless package management: easily install any pure Python package with an intuitive package manager PYTHON SCRIPTS Python scripts are plain-text Python source code files with a .py extension. Juno lets you work on these with snappy code completion, a console with full terminal emulator support, a built-in media viewer for code-generated images, plots, web apps, and more. Juno will execute the code using an embedded Python interpreter, locally on your iPhone or iPad and completely offline. JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS A Jupyter notebook is a versatile document format that enables you to store live code, markdown text, plots, images, and LaTeX equations — all within a single notebook file with a .ipynb extension. Notebooks serve as excellent Python coding playgrounds for data manipulation and experimentation, and Juno makes working with them a breeze! Notebook documents keep a record of all inputs and outputs from an interactive programming session, and the rich output generated by running Python scripts (including HTML, images, video, and plots) is embedded within the Jupyter notebook document. They are particularly convenient for coding in Python for data analysis, machine learning, or computational science in general.",

        "description": "Zero-setup Python environment and developer toolbox in a first-class citizen app for iPad and iPhone. Juno is designed to cover all your Python coding needs, and will work seamlessly with all source code formats. Juno supports both Python scripts (.py) and Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) — a document format focused on applying Python to data analysis and computational science. FREE FEATURES - Navigate and manage files and folders, quickly preview documents and media - Browse and view Jupyter notebooks with quick and beautifully rendered previews - Navigate through code sources, scripts, JSON, XML, and other text-based formats with rich previews and syntax highlighting - Add quick access bookmarks for file system locations outside the app's sandbox, or simply open documents in place PRO FEATURES - Run code in Jupyter notebooks and Python sources locally on your device with a built-in Python 3.10 interpreter, entirely offline - Write and execute Python code in a full-fledged development environment, featuring snappy, intelligent code completion and a console with full terminal emulator support - Access all Jupyter features in a modern, powerful and customizable notebook editor - Leverage powerful data analysis, machine learning and developer tools: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, LXML, and more - View and edit any file as text in a built-in versatile plain text editor with syntax highlighting - Enjoy painless package management: easily install any pure Python package with an intuitive package manager PYTHON SCRIPTS Python scripts are plain-text Python source code files with a .py extension. Juno lets you work on these with snappy code completion, a console with full terminal emulator support, a built-in media viewer for code-generated images, plots, web apps, and more. Juno will execute the code using an embedded Python interpreter, locally on your iPhone or iPad and completely offline. JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS A Jupyter notebook is a versatile document format that enables you to store live code, markdown text, plots, images, and LaTeX equations — all within a single notebook file with a .ipynb extension. Notebooks serve as excellent Python coding playgrounds for data manipulation and experimentation, and Juno makes working with them a breeze! Notebook documents keep a record of all inputs and outputs from an interactive programming session, and the rich output generated by running Python scripts (including HTML, images, video, and plots) is embedded within the Jupyter notebook document. They are particularly convenient for coding in Python for data analysis, machine learning, or computational science in general.",

      "description": "Unleash your creativity and dive into the world of game development with Love2D Game Maker – the ultimate app for creating 2D games on iOS! Love2D Game Maker harnesses the power of Love2D, a popular game development framework, to bring you an intuitive and versatile game creation experience right on your phone or pad. ***Difference between this app with Love2D Studio, and the official app (currently unavailable on App Store and other store)?*** Love2D Game Maker integrates a modified version of the Love2D framework to support windowed mode on both iOS and other mobile platforms. ◉The official Love2D for iOS and other mobile platform only supports fullscreen mode. When running Love2D games designed for Mac, PC, Linux, Steam Deck, Switch, or other game consoles, they are typically optimized for resolutions like 1440x900, 1024x768, or 800x600—standard desktop monitor sizes. These resolutions are not mobile-friendly. On mobile devices, the game graphics are scaled to match the screen size, often distorting the aspect ratio. To address this, I modified the Love2D framework to support any resolution while preserving the aspect ratio. For instance, if your game is designed to run at 1920x1080, Love2D Game Maker creates a window with that resolution, scales it to fit the mobile screen, and ensures the aspect ratio is maintained. Additionally, it supports dragging the game window (like on Mac, PC, or Linux) and landscape mode to maximize the use of the mobile screen. ◉ Powerful Code Editor: Love2D Game Maker includes an advanced code editor, allowing you to write or modify the Lua source code for your games. ◉ Learning Resources: Love2D Game Maker provides access to many open-source games, making it an excellent resource for learning and experimentation. Key Features: Love2D Framework: Built on the Love2D framework, Love2D Game Maker offers a familiar and robust environment for developing 2D games. Take advantage of Love2D's extensive features and libraries to bring your game ideas to life. Feature-Rich Editor: Explore a feature-rich editor designed to streamline your game development process. From creating sprites and animations to scripting game mechanics with Lua, Love2D Game Maker provides all the tools you need to build captivating games. Lua Scripting: Dive into Lua scripting to create dynamic and interactive gameplay experiences. With Love2D Game Maker's Lua support, you have full control over your game's behavior and can unleash your creativity without limitations. Asset Management: Import your own assets or choose from a vast library of sprites, animations, sound effects, and more. Customize every aspect of your game's visuals and audio to match your creative vision. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Export your games to multiple platforms, Share your creations with friends or publish them to app stores worldwide with ease. Active Community: Join a thriving community of Love2D enthusiasts, share your projects, and collaborate with fellow developers. Get inspired by exploring projects created by others and receive valuable feedback on your own creations. Comprehensive Documentation: Access comprehensive documentation and resources to guide you through every step of the game development process. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Love2D Game Maker has you covered. Regular Updates: We're dedicated to enhancing Love2D Game Maker based on your feedback and suggestions.

The totality of microscopic events listed in causality was called a fabula, and the narrative arrangement of these motifs in an artistic way was called a syuzhet. This app is a personal project to learn the technical ingredients of SwiftUI and derive creative results. SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit that can develop applications in a declarative manner. This is a modern development method that communicates to iOS how you want the user interface to behave and finds out how users perform when interacting with the interface. In addition, SwiftUI can develop macOS, watchOS, and tvOS with the same code as well as iOS development. The most appealing thing for me personally is that it is easy to learn and that the code is concise, making it easy for beginners to understand. I hope this project will help everyone, including myself, to understand SwiftUI. The code of this project will be updated regularly. You can share and communicate with developers around the world through the Fabula app. We always look forward to the participation of developers.",

      "description": "Haptics Feedback is powerful tool designed for developers and enthusiasts who want to perfect the tactile experiences on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Why Haptics Feedback? Haptics are an essential part of any modern app, enhancing user engagement by adding physical responses to actions like taps, swipes, or alerts. With Haptics Feedback, you can easily experiment with different types of haptic responses, see how they feel in real time, and get the code snippets you need to implement them in your own projects. Key Features: 1. Comprehensive Haptic Testing: Test the full range of haptic feedback types on iOS and watchOS devices, including: 2. Advanced Haptics Visualizer: For developers who want to dive deeper into the haptics design process, the Advanced View offers a powerful visual representation of the haptic feedback. 3. Apple Watch Haptics Testing: Designing an Apple Watch app or extension? Haptics Feedback offers a seamless way to test and adjust haptics directly on your Apple Watch. Get hands-on with real-time feedback on your wrist. Not wearing your watch? No problem! Use the built-in Apple Watch Haptics Simulator right on your iPhone to see how haptics would perform on the watch. 4. Developer-Focused Design: Haptics Feedback is tailored specifically for developers, providing not only the tools to test and visualize haptics, but also the code snippets needed to implement them. Each feature has been designed to simplify the process of adding haptics to your apps, reducing guesswork and saving you time. Who Is This App For? - App Developers: Enhance the user experience in your apps by integrating perfect haptics that match every action. - Game Developers: Craft immersive and tactile game experiences that pull players deeper into your game world. - UX/UI Designers: Experiment with haptics to bring your interface designs to life and create memorable interactions. - Tech Enthusiasts: Discover how haptic feedback works, experiment with different styles, and learn how to bring a professional touch to app interactions. Why Haptics Matter Imagine pressing a button in your app and feeling a subtle vibration that confirms your action, or getting an alert on your Apple Watch that not only makes a sound but gives you a tap on your wrist. These sensations create a more intuitive, engaging, and satisfying user experience. With Haptics Feedback, you can test these scenarios and make sure they feel just right before adding them to your app.",

In the missions, you will run into many key concepts in neural networks, complete the challenges and acquire a deep understanding. Put neural network lab in your pocket. Variety of datasets: 2D and 3D datasets both with regression and classification. Get the dataset just with a tapping. Do experiments at anytime anywhere. Good visualized neural network knowledges. Key concepts and dynamics are showed with charts and animations. Activations, regularizations, loss functions, classifications, Embedding, CNN1d, CNN2d, RNN and more to come. Visualized Deep Learning Models. Learn the most classic models in an intuitive way that has never been seen before, and quickly master cutting-edge technology. Through modular diagrams, understand how data changes from input to output and how it changes at each step. There are detailed documents for each module, and even reference papers, source codes and animations. Visual neural network model editor. Quickly build a model by dragging your fingers. What you see is what you get: Through real-time calculation and display of the output of each step, the construction of the model has never been so intuitive and efficient; real-time display of various errors, including parameters/input types and value compatibility, etc., abandoning inefficient debugging.
