(Don't forget to enable notifications to stay on top of your new favorites.) *Make us your music concierge.* Watch Tiny Desk Concerts in full right on the app. Just tap the tab labeled ‘Music,’ and hit play to soak in live performances from music’s favorite office space. You can also stream music from around the country, browse the latest music headlines, dig into reviews, and more. *Make everywhere more interesting.* Connect NPR to your speakers wherever you are, via Chromecast, AirPlay, Apple CarPlay, or Bluetooth. Login or register for a free NPR account, then just say \"Alexa, play the news from NPR,\" to have your app listening experience amplified. *Support your listening, and NPR.* The NPR app is free and will always be.
