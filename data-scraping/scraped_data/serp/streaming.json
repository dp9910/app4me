No need to manually transfer programs to your device. “Can these guys do no wrong? Seriously, if only other app devs knew how to make apps as well as these guys, the world would be a better place.

It even works if you have the movies stored on a USB drive connected to the host computer.” -The Times of India “Took me seconds to setup to stream from a secondary drive in my home office. Going straight out to get a cable for my TV.” - USA Reviewer “….This sucker can stream off the pc and plays virtually anything you throw at it.

Save hundreds of dollars a year by subscribing to the Ad-supported tiers of Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock, and Paramount+ and then skip over the ads when you watch with PlayOn (just like you do with your cable DVR). Record and download videos from Netflix before they go offline then watch them anywhere, anytime, even after they have been removed from Netflix. No need to select only the videos that Netflix lets you download, with PlayOn Cloud you can download ANY Netflix or Hulu video. Record and download Disney+ videos to watch offline. The simple PlayOn Cloud app gives you easy access to download all streaming videos from Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, The CW, Discovery+, Showtime, STARZ, Vudu, Pluto, Tubi, CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, PBS, The Roku Channel, and BBC iPlayer, Acorn, Xfinity, and Spectrum.– over 20 of the most popular streaming services. Love House of Dragon, Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or want to watch Moon Knight when you’re offline? Simply select the show you want and hit record. Once recorded, a streaming show or movie will be available for you to download to your mobile device or PC. You can even set it to automatically download to your phone, tablet, or TV as soon as the recording is finished. You can skip right over the recordings automatically when you watch. You can even watch your recordings on your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV (and skip the recordings). The recording happens in the PlayOn Cloud so no data is used to make the recording. Once your PlayOn Cloud recording is downloaded, you can watch it anytime and anywhere. You can watch it on your big screen TV with your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV. No more worrying about a Netflix video leaving. You can even download it to your Mac, PC or other device. No more WiFi requirement to watch on your mobile device – you can download Netflix and watch when you're not on WiFi without using data. Want to watch your downloaded PlayOn Cloud recordings on your TV? You can cast to your TV with Roku, Chromecast or Fire TV or AirPlay it to your Apple TV. Have a long flight tomorrow? Queue up Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or The Mandalorian tonight and they’ll be downloaded and waiting when you take off. Long subway ride to work? With PlayOn Cloud, you’ll be watching downloaded Netflix, The CW, or Disney+ videos the entire time. Need a selection of safe shows for your kids to watch? PlayOn Cloud makes it easy to fill up your kid's device with safe streaming shows - and watch them without using any cellular data, or watching any commercials. When you watch recordings that have commercials, you have an option to automatically skip the ads. How great is that? Want to make PlayOn Cloud even more powerful? Get an optional PlayOn Cloud Storage and Credit plan. You'll get a week to make 7 free recordings. After that you'll be billed $4.99 per month for 30 recordings and 100GB cloud storage.

You can even set it to automatically download to your phone, tablet, or TV as soon as the recording is finished. You can skip right over the recordings automatically when you watch. You can even watch your recordings on your Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV (and skip the recordings). The recording happens in the PlayOn Cloud so no data is used to make the recording.

Queue up Game of Thrones, Jack Ryan or The Mandalorian tonight and they’ll be downloaded and waiting when you take off. Long subway ride to work? With PlayOn Cloud, you’ll be watching downloaded Netflix, The CW, or Disney+ videos the entire time. Need a selection of safe shows for your kids to watch? PlayOn Cloud makes it easy to fill up your kid's device with safe streaming shows - and watch them without using any cellular data, or watching any commercials. When you watch recordings that have commercials, you have an option to automatically skip the ads. How great is that? Want to make PlayOn Cloud even more powerful? Get an optional PlayOn Cloud Storage and Credit plan. You'll get a week to make 7 free recordings. After that you'll be billed $4.99 per month for 30 recordings and 100GB cloud storage.

Use the LimeStreamer app to receive any live internet audio that’s available on the LimeStreamer network and listen directly on your iPhone or iPad. Listen anywhere… at home, on the go or in the car and from anywhere in the world! Finding the audio stream you want is easy. Just enter the Stream ID and listen. You can try it out by connecting to our demo stream which is on 123 123 123. And getting your live audio onto the LimeStreamer network is just as simple. You DON’T need an expensive streaming provider, a streaming server or heaps of technical know-how. You just get the LimeStreamer Encoder unit from us, plug in your audio and boom - you’re online! It’s the highest quality streaming audio. It’s genuinely LIVE (very low delay… so unlike normal streaming audio), low-cost and simple both to setup and to listen. Make your audio available to anyone, put your Stream ID on your website if you wish… or just allow your own group of users or members to listen by keeping your Stream ID private. You can even password-protect your stream if you wish and we’ll encrypt your stream for you. LimeStreamer is both cost effective and simple to install... if you'd like to find out more, visit us online: www.LimeStreamer.com",

Enjoy the show on your big screen. With Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Google Cast enabled device (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported. * The app only works with devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, like Vizio TV, Toshiba TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Sharp TV, Chromecast, Nexus Player, Nvidia Shield gaming console * iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported! * The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). * Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. * If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible. >>> PRO FEATURES * Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room. * Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. * Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. * Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud. * Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV. * Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings. >>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS We want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you.

      "description": "Upflix is a guide that helps you discover where your favorite movies and shows are available on the streaming platforms you already subscribe to. Upflix is great tool for keeping up with releases and discovering where to watch your favorite content on the largest streaming platforms. Your ultimate guide to movies and series on the major streaming services. If you're a subscriber to Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, Max, Hulu, or AppleTV, Upflix is perfect for you! With such a massive combined catalog (Netflix alone has 5000 titles), it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Upflix offers a solution that will impress you and help you navigate more efficiently. - Be the first to know: You'll receive notifications about content added to the platforms. If Netflix adds a new episode of the series you're watching, you'll know. If Prime Video adds a new movie to its catalog, you'll know that too. Upflix will keep you informed firsthand about the latest movies and series. Did you know that Netflix now has \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\"? - User-friendly Guide: Upflix is a practical and simple guide. Everything is quick and straightforward, with no accounts or logins required. Just download and start using it. The only prerequisite is being a subscriber to Netflix or another streaming service that we support. - Expert Reviews: With Upflix, you'll have access to reviews and ratings from specialized websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB, which will help you decide what to watch. If Netflix just released a series and you're not sure if it's good, just check Upflix! - Custom Lists: Upflix offers two different types of lists: a wishlist and a list of the series you're following. If you're watching \"The Witcher\" on Netflix and \"The Last of Us\" on Max, you can add both series and be notified whenever a new episode or season arrives. That way, you won't miss a thing. - Discover where to watch: Not sure on which platform your favorite movie or series is available? Our tool allows you to save time and find where to watch your favorite content. Did you know that \"Lord of The Rings\" is available on Netflix, Hulu, and Max? And that HBO's \"Ballers\" is on Netflix? Oh, did you hear that Netflix removed \"My Neighbor Totoro\"? The Roulette is a premium feature and requires a subscription to be used. The supported platforms are: Netflix, Max, Disney, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, AppleTV+, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll. All film-related metadata used in Upflix, including actor, director and studio names, synopses, release dates, trailers and poster art is supplied by The Movie Database (TMDB).

      "description": "• Featured as \"New and Noteworthy\" and \"Staff Favorite\" by Apple. • Over 500,000 copies downloaded. • Ranked in Top 25 Music Apps for 14 consecutive months. Access and stream your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch Music Library directly over WiFi from an Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, Chromecast or any compatible DLNA device. No Wires or special hardware needed! It can even stream to a PC running Windows Media Player. If you've heard all the hype about AirPlay and are missing out because you don't have an AppleTV, this app is for you! ◆◆◆◆◆ HOW TO USE ◆◆◆◆◆ √ Connect your iPod, iPhone or iPad to the same local network as your Xbox, PS3, PS4 or PC. √ Start AirMusic. √ For Xbox 360, navigate to the Xbox System Music Player and select your device from the list. √ For Xbox One, navigate to the Xbox One Media Player under Apps and select your device in the list. √ For PS3, navigate to the PS3 Music Menu and select your device in the list. If it shows nothing underneath, it probably means you selected the Movie or Photo menu instead. √ For PS4, locate the Media Player in the Store. √ When AirMusic detects a Chromecast device, an icon will appear in the AirMusic navigation bar. Tap on it to connect then select the music you want to stream. √ For a PC running Windows, start Windows Media Player, your iPhone Music will show under 'Other Libraries'. ◆◆◆◆◆ IMPORTANT ◆◆◆◆◆ • AirMusic is not compatible with Apple Music. • AirMusic is compatible with iCloud as long as songs have been downloaded onto your phone. Tap the little cloud download icon next to each song or album in the Music app to download them. • If AirMusic is not detecting all songs, try toggling Sync Library under iOS Settings > Music. • AirMusic requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a minimum of 50MB of disk space to work effectively. • AirMusic is not compatible with old DRM songs purchased on iTunes. Newer iTunes DRM free purchases are compatible. • When using Chromecast, you can choose and change the music directly from within AirMusic. For all other devices, you do it from these devices (ie Xbox, PS3, PC). If you are experiencing any other issues, please contact us at airmusic@plutinosoft.com.
