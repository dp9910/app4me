      "description": "Saucey is alcohol delivery at the push of a button. ASAP or scheduled delivery. No order minimums. We’ll deliver beer, wine, liquor, mixers, ice and party supplies within the hour. So why use Saucey? Picture this: It’s Tuesday at 5:59pm. You think about it, and you realize you went a whole workday without watching that Netflix show. You’d better get home soon. Going to the store takes too much time and you need your wine to meet you at home. Order now, get home... we’ll press play together without a second to spare. It’s Friday. Time to go make some stories for Monday. However, you’ve also had a long week. You are ready to rage - as long as it doesn’t involve a loud club or $12 vodka sodas. You hit the group text, offer up your place for a night of What Do You Meme? and then have Saucey deliver the Tito’s, Club Soda, and enough limes for drinks tonight and Bloody Marys tomorrow. #NightSolved You wake up on a Sunday morning ready for mimosas but not for that long line at the brunch place down the street, so you say “Hey Siri, it’s brunch time.” That’s right, max laziness reached. Use Siri to place your order and, in less than an hour, you’re brunching in bed. Get the picture yet? --HOW IT WORKS-- Saucey is the fastest, easiest and most reliable way to order beer, wine and spirits. Simply pick what you want, checkout, and your Saucey courier will be there in less than an hour - it’s that easy! --DELIVERY ANYWHERE-- We’ll deliver to your apartment, house, office, the beach, the park, the birthday party, even your wedding reception (yes, we have done weddings!)—wherever you need us. —ALCOHOL DELIVERY IN MANY U.S. CITIES-- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Chicago, Dallas, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose, Miami, Orlando, Houston, Austin, Seattle, & Tampa Bay. Plus, more locations are constantly being added! —ASAP OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY— Whether you want alcohol delivered that minute or a week from now, we’ve got you covered. --NO ORDER MINIMUMS-- Sometimes you just want a six pack of beer or bottle of wine, we get it. We won’t peer pressure you, that’s a party foul. --REAL-TIME TRACKING-- Keep tabs on your delivery progress on a live map. Track your courier walking up to your door! --FASTEST ALCOHOL DELIVERY IN TOWN-- Our team works tirelessly to make sure an ice-cold beer can be in your hands in under an hour.

Best of all, it’s completely free to use! We're a new kind of rideshare app. We started up from scratch in 2013, and since then we've grown like crazy all around the world. And now we're bringing our game-changing rides to the USA! It’s an excellent taxi alternative for your trip. You can either find a ride or offer your own driving services through the app, making it super convenient and flexible. inDrive is a great ride-sharing option for rides in Miami. MORE CONTROL Set the price you're happy to pay for rides and choose the driver you want to take you FAIR PRICES Our rides are cheaper because we don't charge drivers big fees SAFETY FIRST Vetted drivers, in-app safety features and a dedicated 24/7 support team As a driver, you have the potential to earn more than a traditional cab driver using a standard transportation app. This is because you have the flexibility to create your own transport schedule and select which rides you wish to take. Why Choose inDrive (a ride app or a driving app) LOW SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR DRIVERS We keep our service payments as low as we can, and they'll actually be 0% for six months from our launch. We think it’s fairer this way. To us, you’re not just another driver who should simply take the rides we give you at the price we decide — no way, you're one of the team. QUICK AND EASY Requesting an affordable ride is quick and easy with this ride-share app. Simply enter your starting point (A) and your destination (B), set your desired fare and select a driver to get started. OFFER YOUR PRICE We understand that finding a reliable and affordable ride can be a stressful experience. That’s why we want to offer you an alternative to traditional cab booking apps. With inDrive, you have the power to customize your rideshare experience. You can choose the driver you feel most comfortable with and set the price that works best for you. CHOOSE YOUR DRIVER With inDrive, you have the power to select your driver from a list of those who have accepted your ride request. In addition, unlike other taxi booking apps, we offer you the freedom to choose based on factors such as price, car model, arrival time, rating, and the number of trips completed. This unique feature sets us apart as a preferred alternative to traditional cab apps. STAY SAFE Before accepting a ride, you can view the driver’s name, car model, license plate number, and the number of completed trips. This level of transparency is not standard in traditional taxi apps. Additionally, our app includes a “Share Your Ride” button, allowing you to share your trip details with family or friends. Our team is dedicated to developing new safety features to ensure a completely secure experience for both riders and drivers. ADD EXTRA OPTIONS By using this alternative taxi application, you have the option to include any specific requirements or additional information in the comments section, such as “traveling with my pet” or “carrying luggage.” The driver will be able to view this information on their driving app before deciding to accept your request. JOIN AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY If you own a car, you can make extra money with our driving app. Unlike other cab booking apps, inDrive lets you view the passenger’s destination and price before accepting the ride. If the price seems inadequate, inDrive offers the option to suggest an alternative price or decline the ride request without penalties. Moreover, this car booking app has low-to-no service rates, meaning you can make more money while driving with this taxi app alternative. Whether you are looking for a new driver app for your trip or need a ride in Miami, you can get a unique rideshare experience with this great cabs & taxi alternative.

With this application you can promptly access tracking information for 300 delivery services, including UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL, TNT, LaserShip, Aramex, OnTrac, China Post, Amazon Logistics and many other carriers. Full list of supported carriers is available at: https://parcel.app With our unique carrier recognition function, adding a new delivery is just a matter of seconds. Sometimes you won't even need to enter a tracking number, you can use a barcode scanner which is available right in the app. Amazon integration in Parcel allows you to get your packages added automatically from your Amazon account. Once an order is shipped, it will appear in Parcel. This is done in a secure and privacy-friendly way with your credentials never leaving the device. You can also locate your delivery on the map or manage your deliveries using Web Access (web.parcelapp.net) - easy and simple. Parcel has a native macOS app available for free in the Mac App Store. Parcel utilizes the power of iOS to provide you the best possible user experience. You can use its widgets to see your upcoming deliveries and the share extension to add a new delivery directly from any other app. Push notifications provided by Parcel are more convenient than from any other app. They are being sent only from 8am to 10 pm according to your timezone, so you will not be bothered at night (however, you can disable this option in the settings). Some features, such as push notifications and tracking more than 3 deliveries are limited to premium subscribers. Current price for the premium subscription is $4.99 per year, and may vary from country to country.

You can now preview and view its details instantly — particularly useful for Amazon deliveries due to account restrictions. Previews in Spotlight Spotlight search has been enhanced. You can now use the Quick Look extension to preview delivery information directly within Spotlight. Changes to Widgets Parcel widgets now use App Intents for configuration. You may need to readjust your widget settings and/or restart your device to complete the migration. Improved Device Management When managing linked devices in the app settings you can now revoke multiple devices at once. New API for Adding Deliveries We’ve introduced a new API that allows you to add deliveries directly to your account. Documentation is available at web.parcelapp.net.",
