      "description": "FEATURE-RICH: PewPee has a lot of useful features. Download music; create your own playlists; add playlists, albums, songs, artists to your library; request music; follow friends; check new releases, top charts, popular playlists, artists; find music by genres; listen in a shuffle mode; set up a sleep timer AND SO ON! ZERO ADS: Yeah, we don’t have any ads. MILLIONS OF SONGS: We have a huge music catalogue including more than 150 million songs from YouTube too. LYRICS: It’s always easier to jam out to your latest favorite song when you know the words. See the lyrics of many of your favorite tracks as they’re sung right from the player or by tapping on View Lyrics in the context menu of a song. FEED: Just bring your friends and start sharing your activity with each other. You can not only see the updates of your friends but also open new songs for yourself or maybe a new taste in music. IMPORT YOUR MUSIC: PewPee delivers its own library to you (and we increase the number of songs every day). However, if you can’t find something you want, with the subscription you are able to import any music (MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, etc.) from your device or use cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. PRIVACY: We don’t provide your data to third-party services. We only store the data that PewPee needs to function as a feature-rich music streaming service. SIMPLE: We believe that apps must have a large number of features and save simplicity in design. PewPee takes care to keep the UI clean and good looking. MORE: PewPee is actively continuing to make the service better and better. We have big plans to improve and create an array of features. Stay tuned by following us on social networks.
