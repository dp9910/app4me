Discover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates. We’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it! • Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips • Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more • Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites • Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available • Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals • Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings • We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner • Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits The fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle). This is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq We’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!",
