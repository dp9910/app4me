An active OneMain account is required to use this app. To apply for a new personal loan, visit OMF.com. APP FEATURES - Make loan payments on the go. - Turn on AutoPay to schedule automatic payments. - Sign up for paperless statements and payment alerts. - Monitor your VantageScore (R) (updated monthly). - Access Trim by OneMain (R) to track your spending and even save some cash. Note: Deleting this app does not close or delete a OneMain account. As a regulated lender and financial institution, we must retain certain records under applicable law. ABOUT ONEMAIN FINANCIAL We provide personal loans that can help you get the money you need, for purposes such as: - Debt consolidation - Home improvement - Auto purchase or repair - Vacations - Emergencies - Major purchases Our minimum and maximum loan repayment periods are 24 months and 60 months. The maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for a personal loan is 35.99%. Minimum and maximum loan amounts are $1,500 and $20,000. Not all applicants qualify for larger loan amounts or most favorable loan terms. Larger loan amounts require a first lien on a motor vehicle no more than 10 years old that meets our value requirements, titled in your name with valid insurance. Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on your state of residence and your ability to meet our credit standards (including a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses and availability of collateral). APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Highly qualified applicants may be offered higher loan amounts and/or lower APRs. Loan proceeds cannot be used for post-secondary educational expenses, for any business or commercial purpose, to buy cryptocurrency or other speculative investments, or for gambling or illegal purposes. Active-duty military, their spouse or dependents covered by the Military Lending Act may not pledge a vehicle as collateral. Borrowers in these states are subject to these minimum loan sizes: Alabama: $2,100. California: $3,000. Georgia: $3,100. North Dakota: $2,000. Ohio: $2,000. Virginia: $2,600. Borrowers in these states are subject to these maximum loan sizes: North Carolina: $11,000 for unsecured loans to all customers; $11,000 for secured loans to present customers. Maine: $7,000. Mississippi: $12,000. West Virginia: $13,500. Loans to purchase a motor vehicle or powersports equipment from select ME, MS, and NC dealerships are not subject to these maximum loan sizes. We charge loan origination fees. Depending on the state where you open the loan, the fee may be a flat amount or percentage of the loan amount. Flat fee amounts vary by state, ranging from $25–$500. Percentage-based fees vary by state, ranging from 1%–10% of the loan, subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. Example Loan: A $6,000 loan with a 24.99% APR repayable in 60 monthly installments would have monthly payments of $176.07. When refinancing or consolidating existing debts, total finance charges over the life of the new loan may be higher than your current debt because the interest rate may be higher and/or the loan term may be longer. Our loans include origination fees, which may reduce the amount of money available to pay off other debts. State Licenses: OneMain Financial Group, LLC (NMLS# 1339418).
