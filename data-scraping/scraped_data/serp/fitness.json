Strong is the simplest and most intuitive workout tracker, designed to help you get better results from your workouts. Whether you want to gain strength or just stay healthy, join over 1.2 million people who have downloaded Strong to stay on track in the gym. “I’d suggest downloading the “Strong” app before you return to the gym. It’s that good” - CNBC “with apps like Strong, working out feels more like a game” - The Verge “I have used nearly every logging app since the App Store launched. This is the best bar none” “I use this every time I go to the gym and seriously couldn't train without it” “Simple. Intuitive. Functional. Exactly what I was looking for.” “This is bare bones and serious. Right on, and works perfectly... I wish I could give 10 stars.” “It's by far the most intuitive and easy to use workout app I’ve used.” Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced powerlifter, Strong provides everything you need to record your workouts as effortlessly and as quickly as possible. Unlike other fitness apps, Strong doesn’t bog you down with distractions and unnecessary gimmicks you’d never use.

If you don’t update by then, your info might stop syncing right. • The old system we used to manage your info isn’t around anymore, so we moved to a new one. It works the same way but with a fresh setup to keep things secure and organized. We switched to a new system that manages your info more securely and keeps everything running well. • We made sure the app still runs fast and stays reliable for you. We’re not done yet, but keep your feedback coming and we’ll continue to build the best workout app yet.",

      "description": "Welcome to the new Bodybuilding.com app. Designed with seven different ways to workout, trackable health metrics, a customized social experience and an in-app shopping hub for your supplements needs, the BBCOM app is the key to unlocking your true potential. Though don’t just take our word for it. Dive into why you should download the Bodybuilding.com app now. 1. Choose Your Workout Experience Follow along with guided workouts led by our coaches, choose an accessory, dive into a multi-week program, design your own workout/progrram, stack your experiences, or learn new moves with our movement library. There’s a way to work out for everyone. Our team of Master Coaches consists of accredited professionals with decades of experience. They’ll lead multiple modalities ranging from strength and hypertrophy to body recomp and performance. Need a time out? Pause a workout at any time to watch the movement tutorial without exiting. Time for a rest day? Jump into an accessory to take a breathwork, stretching or mobility sequence. Take planning into your own hands by constructing a workout or program specific to you. Build out your calendar using the move library or stack pre-existing workouts together. Find your routine with endless possibilities. 2. Connect With Likeminded Users Chasing goals requires support, and when it comes to finding support, community is king. Build your profile, share content, and scroll the feed to find your favorite lifters, workouts, and accounts. Don’t want to share with the world? No sweat. Set your profile to private and accept invites when they come. You’ll be able to like, comment, share and save content in your feed. Stay tuned for our “Groups” feature coming in 2025- where locals can plan meetups IRL, because nothing beats training together. 3. Track Metrics and Store Data Stored in your profile, connect to Health Kit or Google Health Services to stay on top of heart rate, calories, and other key metrics. Trying to break down your splits? “Blue Man” is here to help track which muscle groups you’ve worked this week to help inform your next workout selection. We’ll be revealing fitness devices eligible for syncing in 2025. 4. Earn Badges and Rewards It’s true, we’re all still utterly obsessed with collecting badges, and you can collect a set of your very own in the app. From “total weight lifted” milestones, to streak celebrations and limited-edition holiday badges, there’s a new goal to chase every month.

Though don’t just take our word for it. Dive into why you should download the Bodybuilding.com app now. 1. Choose Your Workout Experience Follow along with guided workouts led by our coaches, choose an accessory, dive into a multi-week program, design your own workout/progrram, stack your experiences, or learn new moves with our movement library. There’s a way to work out for everyone. Our team of Master Coaches consists of accredited professionals with decades of experience. They’ll lead multiple modalities ranging from strength and hypertrophy to body recomp and performance. Need a time out? Pause a workout at any time to watch the movement tutorial without exiting. Time for a rest day? Jump into an accessory to take a breathwork, stretching or mobility sequence. Take planning into your own hands by constructing a workout or program specific to you. Build out your calendar using the move library or stack pre-existing workouts together. Find your routine with endless possibilities. 2. Connect With Likeminded Users Chasing goals requires support, and when it comes to finding support, community is king. Build your profile, share content, and scroll the feed to find your favorite lifters, workouts, and accounts. Don’t want to share with the world? No sweat. Set your profile to private and accept invites when they come. You’ll be able to like, comment, share and save content in your feed. Stay tuned for our “Groups” feature coming in 2025- where locals can plan meetups IRL, because nothing beats training together. 3. Track Metrics and Store Data Stored in your profile, connect to Health Kit or Google Health Services to stay on top of heart rate, calories, and other key metrics.
