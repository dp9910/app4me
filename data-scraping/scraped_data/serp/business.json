      "description": "Relive one of the most iconic board game series of all time, the classic Business game. Perhaps the best-known of all modern board games, Business is the game of buying and selling real estate. Snap up as many squares of land, utilities and railroads. The objective of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money. Business is derived from The Landlord's Game. Wheel and deal as you build your fortune playing an exciting game of Business online: Monopolist. Buy up whole neighbourhoods, charge rent, and watch your empire grow. It's all about making deals and making money. But don't land in Jail! You better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Business Game: Monopolist is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail. Play with your Facebook friends, against the computer, against your friends in Local Multiplayer or with millions of Business players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode. You can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.
