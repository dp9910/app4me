That's why millions of people choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. Our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. While our optional integrated AI features, Search Assist and Duck.ai, are private and never use your data to train AI. Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads, not by exploiting your data. Take back control of your personal information with the browser designed for data protection, not data collection. FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS Protect Your Searches by Default: DuckDuckGo Search comes built-in, so you can easily search online without being tracked. Shield Your Browsing History: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection blocks most trackers before they load, greatly exceeding what most popular browsers offer by default. Chat Privately with AI: Duck.ai lets you have private conversations with 3rd-party AI models, anonymized by us and never used to train AI. Secure Your Email (Optional): Use Email Protection to block most email trackers and hide your existing email address with @duck.com addresses. Watch YouTube Videos Without Targeted Ads: Duck Player protects you from targeted ads and cookies with a distraction-free interface that incorporates YouTube’s strictest privacy settings for embedded video. Automatically Enforce Encryption: Shield your data from network and Wi-Fi snoopers by forcing many sites to use an HTTPS connection. Escape Fingerprinting: Make it harder for companies to create a unique identifier for you by blocking attempts to combine info about your browser and device. Sync and Back Up Securely (Optional): Sync encrypted bookmarks and passwords across your devices. Clear your tabs and browsing data in a flash with the Fire Button. Banish cookie pop-ups and automatically set your preferences to minimize cookies and maximize privacy. And many more protections not available on most browsers, even in private browsing mode, including protection from link tracking, Global Privacy Control (GPC), and more. DUCKDUCKGO SUBSCRIPTION Subscribers get • Our VPN: Secure your connection on up to 5 devices. • Access to advanced AI models in Duck.ai: Chat privately with AI models built for complex tasks. • Personal Information Removal: Find and remove personal info from sites that store and sell it (access on desktop). • Identity Theft Restoration: If your identity is stolen, we’ll help restore it. DuckDuckGo Subscription Pricing & Terms Payment will be charged automatically to your Apple Account until you cancel, which you can do in app settings. You have the option to provide an email address to activate your subscription on other devices, and we will only use that email address to verify your subscription.

In that tab you'll find information like the IP, IPv6, other addresses or the data usage statistics about your Wi-Fi, Internet or Cellular connection (if any). ► CELLULAR DATA MONITOR Don't lose sight of your data usage, with four taps you'll have a data monitor configured and ready to use. The following data usage plans' period are supported: - Daily - Weekly - Monthly - 28 days - 30 days - 90 days ► LAN SCANNER Analyze your Wi-Fi with the LAN Scanner tool. Discovering who is connected to your network and Ping it, is a matter of two taps. Easily manage custom subnets to scan only a portion of your LAN. ► PING Ping a LAN device, Ping a server, ping whatever you want. IPv6 addresses are supported too and advanced options like packet size, timeouts, intervals, etc.. are available and easily configurable. The results of your Ping are available numerically in the aggregated stats, graphically in the real time graph or listed, a row per ICMP response received. ► GEO IP Have you ever wondered where a server or any other IP is located? That's the tool for you, show the location on a map and get additional details like the ISP or the ASN in the details pane. ► DIG A DNS lookup utility made simple. A list clearly shows the result of your query and the advanced options allow you to customize your request from the type of query to the DNS server. ► WHOIS Find any information about a domain name and it's owner e.g. the status, creation date, registrant email and address and many more. ► NSLOOKUP A no-frills textual DNS lookup utility. ► WIDGET * Network Utility comes with an useful widget that brings network informations and the cellular data usage into your notification center, home screen e lock screen. ► EXPORT RESULTS ANYWHERE Every utility has an export button that allows you to export the result of your task to the File app, to the Notes app and many other apps or simply copy the raw textual result. ► MAC APP Network Utility is also available on the Mac App Store as Network Kit X, the same app but tuned to take advantage of macOS. Start a tool on your iPhone/iPad a continue it on your Mac thanks to Handoff and Continuity. !! N.B. - Cellular data monitor is available only on iPhone or iPad with Cellular. - LAN Scanner on iOS 11 and upper due to a limitation of the OS can't display the MAC address of the discovered devices. Hostname resolution is available only if you don't use an external DNS. - Widgets on iOS 14 are updated only at scheduled intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes), so they can show outdated info. Open the app to get info updated in real time. - Data usage widget, full featured network state widgets and lock screen widgets are available only with the Pro upgrade",

      "description": "Meet TapMeasure, the spatial utility that combines computer vision and AR, creating a whole new way to capture and measure your space. ▶ 3D Room Builder Create scale-accurate 3D models of rooms that you can measure and review immediately, or revisit later. ▶ Quick Measure Capture point-to-point measurements with just two taps. ▶ Smart Level Ensure picture frames and artwork are perfectly level, automatically. TapMeasure is the fastest, smartest way to measure a physical space. Period. Additional Features: • Geometric Recognition: Automatically detect rectangular objects like doors, windows, artwork, and more, and add them to your model. • Quick Outlining: Create simple outlines of items on the walls or floor. • Easy Sharing: Send your 3D model to anyone with a simple URL. • SketchUp Export: Export your 3D model as an .SKP file, allowing you to view and edit in both free and pro versions of SketchUp. We built TapMeasure as an easy to use, everyday spatial utility — but it also works great for pros, including interior designers, architects, contractors, real estate agents, appraisers, insurance agents, and anyone that needs quick, approximate 3D models and measurements. TapMeasure combines the new ARKit framework in iOS 11 with advanced computer vision, to recognize and track objects. Since TapMeasure uses ARKit, you'll need an ARKit-compatible device (iPhone 6s or newer). TapMeasure is built by the team at Occipital (occipital.com). We're the same team behind 360 Panorama, Structure Sensor, Canvas, Bridge, and other spatial computing products. We can't wait to see what you create with TapMeasure!",

This updated phone application builds on the customer’s ability to access their account 24 hours a day, seven days per week, 365 days per year. In the past, utility customers could view balance information, make a payment, view statement and payment history, view usage graphs and access all their accounts at one time. With this the new release, utility customers will have access to many additional enhancements such as payment arrangement balances, programs they are enrolled in, enhanced usage graph, ability to sign up for notifications, report outages, view the utility outage map (if available), view the utility contact information, and view a message from the utility as they log into the app. The customer can even log into the application with a touch of their finger or facial recognition by setting up biometric login.",

Then, track your sleep in the app. Alarm Clock HD is the app to help you enjoy restful sleep and wake up worry-free. How Alarm Clock HD helps you sleep better: • Unlimited Alarms: Apple Music or Alarm Sounds • Customize Nightstand display colors • Sleep Timer • Local Weather Information • Instant Flashlight - shake the device • Full watchOS 2 support • Screen Saver - for devices with OLED display WAKE UP ON TIME: Proper Alarm Settings • Keep the app open and running always to have your alarm go off and play the sounds you’ve set for ‘Music'. When your app is open, you can use the volume slider within the app. When the app is in the background, use the device volume to set your volume. • Make sure your battery is charged and have your notifications turned on before you go to sleep, when the battery level goes below 30% it might not sound. This is due to prevent the device from dying and the alarm not going off. • Keep your Apple Music available on your device The music you can select consists of everything you have available on your ‘Apple Music' app on your device. If the music is saved on your iCloud, and not on the device itself, it won’t be available. NEVER MISS AN ALARM When you close the app and do not have it running in the background, the alarm will use the device volume instead and play the notification sound system. The app will close itself automatically after 10 hours of inactivity. This is due to prevent the device from dying and the alarm not going off. When your device is muted, set to ‘Do Not Disturb’, or your device volume is set to 0, the alarm won’t play properly. It will still show the notification without any sound. This is due to Apple’s restrictions as we are unable to access the app settings when the app is closed, only when it’s open or running in the background.

This updated phone application builds on the customer’s ability to access their account 24 hours a day, seven days per week, 365 days per year. In the past, utility customers could view balance information, make a payment, view statement and payment history, view usage graphs and access all their accounts at one time. With this the new release, utility customers will have access to many additional enhancements such as payment arrangement balances, programs they are enrolled in, enhanced usage graph, ability to sign up for notifications, report outages, view the utility outage map (if available), view the utility contact information, and view a message from the utility as they log into the app. The customer can even log into the application with a touch of their finger or facial recognition by setting up biometric login.",
