Join us today as we embark on creating a healthier and happier workforce. Our Story In the wake of burnout from relentless startup endeavors, founders D Sharma and Julie Sharma embarked on a transformative journey of self-care. Their path led them to a serene retreat in Thailand, where the wisdom of a monk/coach introduced them to the power of journaling, meditation, and living in the moment. This pivotal experience ignited a profound realization: the life-changing benefits of personal coaching, a privilege once reserved for elite athletes, should be accessible to everyone. Inspired to bridge this gap, they, together with their friend Bhartesh, founded Wellness Coach. With a mission to make wellness readily accessible for all, Wellness Coach offers a comprehensive suite of mental and physical health services, from multilingual digital health resources to personalized coaching and clinical solutions. It's more than a company; it's a movement to empower individuals to navigate life's challenges with grace and resilience, inspired by the founders' own journey toward healing and growth. -D, Julie and Bhartesh.

Are you ready to take your inner dialogue out of your head and gain a new perspective on life? Because if you are, we’ve got tools to help you observe your experiences and reframe your days. Sounds good? CHECK OUT OUR APPROACH: • Personalized program Set a clear, achievable goal—whether it's improving your self-image, saying \"no,\" or challenging negative thoughts. Choose your direction, and we'll help you get there with evidence-based techniques and tools. • Mood tracker Pause during the day to check in with your emotions. See how you're doing—Good, Bad, Amazing! Use our emotional menu to name your feelings, notice what triggered them, and track changes over time with the Mood Calendar. • Routine builder Check out our Tasks tool to plan new activities and get ideas for things to try each day. By adding new tasks and routines to your days, you can change your behaviour and transform. • AI companion Ever wish someone would listen to you rant without judgment, even at 3 a.m.? Meet Livie, our AI companion. If you're tired of the inner dialogue or need a fresh perspective on life, just talk to her. She'll help you break down your situations and suggest new ideas to try. • Bite-size knowledge Scientists have studied the human mind for over 100 years, uncovering how our emotions, thoughts, and actions connect to unconscious \"auto-pilot\" behaviors. We've distilled this knowledge into bite-sized insights for you to apply in your decision-making. • Well-being tests Everyone loves quizzes! Take a break and answer a set of questions to define experiences you’re going through. Check back every week to track the changes in emotional and behavioural dynamics. • Deep focus soundscapes When you don’t feel like listening to music but still want to wear headphones and block out the world, try our soundscapes. ——————— WHAT OUR USERS ARE SAYING ABOUT US \"Positive thoughts and a calmer attitude come after 10 minutes of use.\" \"Great app to use as a guide at the start of your day.\" \"Liven is helping me turn healthy activities into habits.\" ——————— SUBSCRIPTION AND TERMS After you decide to begin your growth with Liven and download the app, you can unlock all features by subscribing to the premium subscription.

      "description": "Traditional workouts aren't for everyone. And that's OK! With EasyWellness, you can craft your own personal *glow up*. EasyWellness helps you build fundamental habits so you can improve your flexibility, mobility, stress management, sleep, lung health, cardiovascular health, water intake, digestion and even cardio — in just a few minutes per day. You don't need to sweat it out in a gym or run a marathon to be healthy— wellness can be easy, and we show you how. With enhanced INSIGHTS, you can track all your EasyWellness stats and see how you've progressed. Check your progress with weekly and monthly statistics in graphs and highlights. Tracking your progress is one of the best tools to achieve your goals. If you’re trying to get healthier, but keep quitting when life gets in the way, you can benefit from EasyWellness. We’ve got programs to help you on the road to a healthier life – Stretching Routines, Breathing Exercises, Water Tracker, Step Counter and the Wellness Library. HOW DOES EASYWELLNESS WORK? EasyWellness programs are fundamental to your health. These are habits that you CAN keep up! They don’t require a huge time or energy commitment. Add a little EasyWellness to your day and you will reap the benefits in the long term. #Stretching - Improve flexibility and mobility. No matter your age or body type, flexibility and mobility are the key to completing daily activities easily and without injury. Stretching can also improve with pain and posture. #Breathing - There is no denying that stress and sleep are huge factors in our overall health. Breathing exercises are a powerful tool in stress reduction and better sleep. Our app will guide you through these exercises so you can be at your best. #Hydration - Staying hydrated and drinking more water can be difficult, but not with our water tracker. Improve digestion and curb cravings when you hit your daily water needs. #Movement - Walking has incredible benefits as a form of exercise and is low impact: It helps with weight management, cardiovascular health and can boost your mood. The EasyWellness Step Counter helps beginners create the habit of walking more throughout their day. #Wellness Library - Articles, tips and quizzes to help you along your wellness journey. BENEFITS: - Change your approach towards healthy living with simple programs you can do regularly - Loosen tight muscles - Improve flexibility, mobility and balance - Gently fight the effects of aging - Easily combined with your personalized nutritional needs - Boost energy - No burnout - Sleep better - Improve focus and concentration - Increase lung capacity - Curb cravings - Reduce stress and increase mindfulness and more! ** Taking motivation out of the equation! ** Motivation isn’t something that we can rely on when it comes to getting healthier and self care. That’s why EasyWellness has customizable time frames. Do what you can and keep up your streak! MORE FEATURES: - Create your own stretch routines: Users can now create their own routines with the Create Your Own Mix feature. This is perfect for people with injuries that need to work on (or avoid) certain areas. - Weekly and monthly insights show how you've progressed. - Audio, Visual Graphics and Text Instructions - Haptic Vibrations for discrete breathing exercises - Friendly reminders - Easy scheduling calendar - Challenges, streaks and achievement badges - Dark mode for night time stretching, breathing exercises and browsing JOIN THE COMMUNITY Instagram: https://instagram.com/easywellness.app Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/easywellnessapp Contact: support@littlebylittlelabs.com Terms of Service: https://www.easywellness.app/terms Privacy Policy: https://www.easywellness.app/privacy Copyright © 2021 LITTLE BY LITTLE LABS LLC",

      "description": "Hey, welcome the Gentler Streak - the app that keeps your active life alive! An award-winning health and fitness tracker offers personalized guidance that adapts to your daily capabilities and not the other way around. For those of us who want to move consistently, not constantly. Built with care by a small indie team. • 2024 Apple Design Award - Social Impact | 2022 Apple Watch App of the Year | App of the Day | Editor’s Choice • Featured in The Verge, Forbes, TechCrunch, and more. ▶UNDERSTAND YOUR DAILY READINESS◀ [KEY HEALTH METRICS] Start your day with a summary of key vitals and sleep, helping you detect changes before you feel them. Receive workout suggestions that respond to your readiness. Set home screen widgets to bring this info closer to you. [FULL SLEEP ANALYSIS] See everything from sleep onset to how much restorative sleep you are getting. View trends over 14 nights in sleep duration, consistency, and stages to spot patterns and improve your sleep hygiene. [NEW - DAILY STEPS, DONE DIFFERENTLY] You can now track daily steps, distance, walking time, flights climbed, and walking heart rate—all with a 14-day trend overview. Our approach doesn’t push you to chase step goals. Instead, it helps you understand your daily movement patterns—ideal for everyday walkers and those managing chronic conditions.

        "release_note": "Widget. New Widget. New Period Widget. Now, alongside Activity Status, Go Gentler, Vitals, and Single Vital, you can also add a Period widget to your Home Screen! Yay! Different phases of the menstrual cycle can affect how workout-ready your body feels. Keeping them in view helps keep them in mind and this widget does just that. It shows the current phase, cycle day, and expected readiness. Still, period is just one piece of your wellbeing picture, something to help you understand your patterns better. How cycle phases affect us varies greatly from person to person. It’s best to observe yourself and add notes with your workouts to learn what’s true for you, and then adapt your behaviour to it. To add a period widget (or any other) follow these steps: 1. Touch and hold an empty spot on your Home Screen until apps start jiggling. 2. Tap the + or Edit button (depending on your iOS version). 3. Search for Gentler Streak and swipe through widgets - the Period one’s last. 4. Tap Add Widget, and drag to wherever you’d like it to be. If you find Gentler Streak helpful, leaving a review on the App Store is one of the best ways to support us. For a small team, your reviews and ratings matter a lot! They help others discover us more easily, and help them understand what to expect from the app. Good ones also make our day. Got feedback? Let us know!

      "description": "SIX turns the Apple Watch or wearable you already own into a personal dashboard for mental and emotional wellness. Using 20+ years of neuroscience, it reveals what lifts your energy, lowers your stress, and helps you thrive. You’ll see exactly how your brain responds to everyday moments—so you can do more of what moves you and less of what drains you. WHAT YOU GET WITH SIX • Live Emotional Fitness Scores: See how your brain responds in real time—measured as Value (emotional resonance) and Safety (stress vs. calm). • Daily Key Moments: Automatically capture the six most emotionally meaningful moments your brain experiences each day. • Mood & Energy Forecasts: Know how you’ll feel tomorrow—plan, recover, and perform with clarity. • Local Recommendations: Personalized suggestions for local finds, media, and podcasts that are likely to create Key Moments for you. • Personalized Insights: Discover what fuels your mood, energy, and focus—and repeat what works. • No Extra Hardware Needed: Works with Apple Watch, WHOOP, Oura Ring, Fitbit, Garmin & more.

Using 20+ years of neuroscience, it reveals what lifts your energy, lowers your stress, and helps you thrive.

A COACH IN YOUR POCKET Powered by AI, Coach by Therabody creates intelligent, personalized recovery plans based on your fitness goals, activity data, and latest scientific research.

Founded in 2017 by Katie and Craig Gironda, Revitalize Wellness is more than a supplement company—it’s a mission rooted in the power of orthomolecular medicine. Katie’s journey began with frustration over her declining health and conventional medicine’s limitations. In 2014, an online health board introduced her to the life-changing benefits of Vitamin C. Inspired by her recovery, she created the Vitamin C and Orthomolecular Medicine for Optimal Health Facebook group, now a thriving community of over 90,000 members sharing scientific insights and healing stories. Determined to make high-quality supplements accessible, Katie and Craig launched Revitalize Wellness, prioritizing purity and affordability. In 2023, new owners—Hendrick, Marlene, and Jason Klop—joined the mission, bringing fresh expertise to continue delivering premium wellness solutions.",

      "description": "Being active has never been more rewarding! CARROT is a free app that rewards you financially for walking. By walking and achieving individualized activity goals, users earn virtual currencies that can be used to play games, compete in challenges, bid on an auction and earn rewards (such as digital gift cards) that are available right on the app. Those rewards can be won in live, real-time “instant” auctions! CARROT has successfully gamified health and wellness, including several fun features available to all users. “CARROT Survivor” is a last-person-standing competition that challenges contestants to make their personal goals each and every day. “Versus” contests include weekly fantasy football competitions during the fall as well as similar games throughout the year. And CARROT’s “Unlockables” requires you to achieve a personal goal streak to access special prizes. CARROT offers iPhone users several great features: (1) Using Apple HealthKit, CARROT gives you a personalized “Activity Goal”, based on your own activity history, which is updated daily. Push yourself just a little bit more each day, make your personal goals, and then reap the rewards! (2) CARROT’s Apple Watch app allows users to conveniently monitor their daily activity progress with just a tap. (3) Using iBeacon technology, users can earn bonus Reward Points for activities such as community health programs and for visiting participating businesses. This is done in the background with low-energy Bluetooth. (4) And as a fully inclusive program, CARROT provides the opportunity for manual wheelchair users to participate by being rewarded for their “pushes”, rather than “steps”. (Note: The use of an Apple Watch is required to accurately collect push data for use on CARROT.) All CARROT users earn one Reward Point for each step they take. Premium Members – including those who are sponsored by their employer through a CARROT Corporate Wellness Program – can also earn CARROTcoins for achieving personalized activity goals. You can get a one-month Premium Membership with an In-App purchase. With CARROT, there’s no need to purchase a wearable tracker – everything, including your steps data and rewards, is stored exclusively on your phone. The app doesn’t even have to be on or running for you to earn points. (But if you already own a tracker, CARROT accepts data from most popular devices.) Would you like your employer to offer CARROT rewards to you and your coworkers? “CARROT Health & Wellness” is a special, low-cost program that offers employees exclusive company-sponsored rewards such as digital gift cards – available directly through the app – just for meeting daily activity goals. Employers can launch their own CARROT Wellness pilot program by entering their information on the CARROT “Wellness” screen. Because CARROT respects your privacy, you have the option to sign in using your phone number, Facebook or anonymously. Anonymous (“Guest”) users should beware that, since all data is stored only on the device, you will permanently lose all relevant data and earned rewards if you log out or delete the app. Many exclusive rewards are made available based on your location, and you can also receive bonus Reward Points for visiting CARROT businesses and other locations -- so please be sure to allow “location services”. (Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.) Easy to use. Convenient. Personalized. Free. When it comes to Fitness Rewards, nothing beats CARROT!",

        "description": "Being active has never been more rewarding! CARROT is a free app that rewards you financially for walking. By walking and achieving individualized activity goals, users earn virtual currencies that can be used to play games, compete in challenges, bid on an auction and earn rewards (such as digital gift cards) that are available right on the app. Those rewards can be won in live, real-time “instant” auctions! CARROT has successfully gamified health and wellness, including several fun features available to all users. “CARROT Survivor” is a last-person-standing competition that challenges contestants to make their personal goals each and every day. “Versus” contests include weekly fantasy football competitions during the fall as well as similar games throughout the year. And CARROT’s “Unlockables” requires you to achieve a personal goal streak to access special prizes. CARROT offers iPhone users several great features: (1) Using Apple HealthKit, CARROT gives you a personalized “Activity Goal”, based on your own activity history, which is updated daily. Push yourself just a little bit more each day, make your personal goals, and then reap the rewards! (2) CARROT’s Apple Watch app allows users to conveniently monitor their daily activity progress with just a tap. (3) Using iBeacon technology, users can earn bonus Reward Points for activities such as community health programs and for visiting participating businesses. This is done in the background with low-energy Bluetooth. (4) And as a fully inclusive program, CARROT provides the opportunity for manual wheelchair users to participate by being rewarded for their “pushes”, rather than “steps”. (Note: The use of an Apple Watch is required to accurately collect push data for use on CARROT.) All CARROT users earn one Reward Point for each step they take. Premium Members – including those who are sponsored by their employer through a CARROT Corporate Wellness Program – can also earn CARROTcoins for achieving personalized activity goals. You can get a one-month Premium Membership with an In-App purchase. With CARROT, there’s no need to purchase a wearable tracker – everything, including your steps data and rewards, is stored exclusively on your phone. The app doesn’t even have to be on or running for you to earn points. (But if you already own a tracker, CARROT accepts data from most popular devices.) Would you like your employer to offer CARROT rewards to you and your coworkers? “CARROT Health & Wellness” is a special, low-cost program that offers employees exclusive company-sponsored rewards such as digital gift cards – available directly through the app – just for meeting daily activity goals. Employers can launch their own CARROT Wellness pilot program by entering their information on the CARROT “Wellness” screen. Because CARROT respects your privacy, you have the option to sign in using your phone number, Facebook or anonymously. Anonymous (“Guest”) users should beware that, since all data is stored only on the device, you will permanently lose all relevant data and earned rewards if you log out or delete the app. Many exclusive rewards are made available based on your location, and you can also receive bonus Reward Points for visiting CARROT businesses and other locations -- so please be sure to allow “location services”. (Disclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.) Easy to use. Convenient. Personalized. Free. When it comes to Fitness Rewards, nothing beats CARROT!",
