      "description": "Signal is a messaging app with privacy at its core. It is free and easy to use, with strong end-to-end encryption that keeps your communication completely private. • Send texts, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs, and files for free. Signal uses your phone’s data connection, so you avoid SMS and MMS fees. • Call your friends with crystal-clear encrypted voice and video calls. Group calls supported for up to 50 people. • Stay connected with group chats up to 1,000 people. Control who can post and manage group members with admin permission settings. • Share image, text, and video Stories that disappear after 24 hours. Privacy settings keep you in charge of exactly who can see each Story. • Signal is built for your privacy. We know nothing about you or who you’re talking to. Our open source Signal Protocol means that we can’t read your messages or listen to your calls. Neither can anyone else. No back doors, no data collection, no compromises. • Signal is independent and not for profit; a different kind of tech from a different kind of organization.

      "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users. FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe. SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again. UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork. RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs. SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it. PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads. For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient. We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

And if it DOES happen again, the app will clear any unnecessary notifications on the next Discord app launch. The following issues have also been cleaned up: - Sharing multiple images to Discord via the Share Sheet should now preserve the order of images properly. - Fixed multi-image embeds only showing the last image, as if you only heard a joke’s punchline before the rest of it. - Resolved an issue where the Camera Flip button wouldn’t function properly... although it still doesn’t make your phone do a backflip. As always, see what else we’ve been cookin’ (or, I guess, uncooked?) over at dis.gd/PatchNotes",

Slack brings everyone from coworkers, customers, and contractors into one secure place, so you don’t have to chase approvals or wait around on emails. Slack even has AI that can search to find the information you need instantly and summarize conversations to catch you up with a click. Better yet, Slack makes it easy for anyone on your team to automate the small stuff, giving everyone more time to focus on the big picture. AKA, growing your business. COLLABORATE QUICKER. Work alongside teammates and external partners securely in Slack. • Connect with everyone: Invite vendors, customers, and contractors to work with you and your coworkers — all in one place. • Video chat face-to-face, from anywhere: Meet with teammates instantly through video conferencing, and discuss work live with screen sharing. • Crystal-clear communication: Use voice notes when text alone doesn’t cut it, ensuring complicated messages are better understood. • Stay organized: Keep project, customer, and product conversations in dedicated channels and documents. ACCESS YOUR KNOWLEDGE. Slack is where you can find every file, message, and decision. • Find anything, instantly: Our intelligent, AI-powered search understands context and saves you from digging around to find the answers you need to do your job.** • Collaborate on deliverables: Co-create marketing plans, product specs, and more in shared documents that live right next to your team’s conversations. • Streamline project execution: Track tasks, owners, and priorities with project management tools and lists that connect seamlessly to the rest of your work.* • Create consistent processes: Make sure every new project is set up to succeed with Slack-generated or custom-created* templates. • Capture meeting notes automatically: Let AI transcribe and summarize meeting notes for you in Slack, so you can focus on the conversation.** PERFECT EVERY PROCESS. Let Slack automations do your busywork for you. • Centralize your work: Connect to 2,600+ apps and focus just on Slack, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Asana, Zapier, Figma, Zendesk, and more. • Manage routine tasks: Approve PTO requests, manage your calendar, or update file permissions — all in one place (talk about convenient). • Stay on top of your to-dos: Manage your to-do list from your notepad to where you’re getting the rest of your work done. • Bring the power of Agentforce to your team: Access AI agents to respond to HR tickets, set team reminders, resolve IT issues, and much more.*** *Requires an upgrade to Slack Pro, Business+, or Enterprise. **Requires Slack AI add-on ***Requires Agentforce license from Salesforce",

Our mission is to have an accessible tool that is user friendly, simple to use and effective in the teaching of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) Visuals2Go is an ALL-IN-ONE Educational app created to support people with communication and learning difficulties. Research shows that Augmentative and Assistive Communication systems are highly beneficial for people who are non-verbal or have difficulties with speech. Visuals2Go is designed to support you as an Educator, Therapist, Support Worker or Parent so that you can give the person in your care a voice. It is distinct from other Augmentative and Alternate Communication (AAC) in it’s versatility. It is designed to support people with a range of different communicative needs: from students with high support needs who needs a single message communication system, to choice making using two or more images, to sentence building to extend vocabulary. It also supports those who needs hands-on visuals so the app allows users to PRINT their visuals on a range of different templates. The app has a Simple-to-use interface and beautifully designed images that will encourage regular access to communication and learning. We believe that if the Educators, therapists, support workers or parents are actively using a software that is highly beneficial, then the person with a communication need will most likely be using it as well. The app is useful for verbal and non-verbal learners, it can be used for individuals in the Autism Spectrum, individuals with Down Syndrome or other diagnosis. Here are some of the ways you can use Visuals2Go: * Use it as communication device for those struggling with speech. Users can make choices directly or use the ‘Sentence Strip’ feature to communicate in sentences; * Use it for Visual Prompts, our new 'Card Search' feature allows you to easily search for thousands of images to provide a visual prompt for directions or for learning; * For students with Higher Support needs, you can use the App as a one button (or one message) communication device; * Use it as a lanyard - carrying all your symbols on your device, with an easy SWIPE-TO-SCROLL through cards feature; * Create countless number of visual cards in various sizes to print off and laminated for hands-on learning (Optional Upgrade); * Print cards on a range of customised visual boards from our templates for a variety purposes including choice boards, shopping lists, flash cards and more (Optional Upgrade); * Create stories for learning - You can use to create stories to learn social skills and step-by-step recipes or procedures. * Or simply use it as a photo album with text and voice. Store albums of family members; friends; favourite toys; characters; etc. Your child will love scrolling to see each Visual! The app is constantly updated with new images and albums. You have a choice to upgrade the app with added features with individual inApp purchases or with a subscription. Please note: If you purchase a monthly or yearly access to the online library, payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

      "description": "Parents who are divorced, separated, or were never legally married use TalkingParents to manage all communication regarding their children. Whether your co-parenting situation is amicable or high conflict, our cutting-edge tools make joint custody easier to navigate, while keeping interactions saved to a court-admissible Record. TalkingParents is here to help you coordinate more seamlessly, set boundaries, and focus on what matters most: your children. Secure Messaging: Send messages that can’t be edited or deleted and easily organize them by topic. All messages and read receipts are timestamped, allowing you to see when your co-parent sent or viewed a message. Accountable Calling: Make phone and video calls, complete with recordings and transcripts, without ever having to share your phone number. Shared Calendar: Manage custody schedules and your child’s appointments and activities all on a Shared Calendar that both parents can access. Create single events for things like doctor’s appointments and repeating events for your child’s extracurriculars and custody transition days. Accountable Payments: Make payment requests and securely send or receive money, allowing you to keep track of all shared parenting expenses. Requests and payments are timestamped, and you can also schedule monthly recurring payments. Info Library: Share important details about the kids with customizable cards that both parents can access without having to contact each other. This feature is a great place to store frequently used information like clothing sizes, medical information, and more. Personal Journal: Keep private notes about thoughts and interactions you want recorded for later. Whether it’s in-person discussions with your co-parent or child behavior observances, journal entries are just for you and can include up to five attachments. Vault File Storage: Store photos, videos, and important documents. Your Vault cannot be accessed by your co-parent, but you may choose to share files with any third party by copying or emailing a link, which can be set to expire. You can also download files to your device. Unalterable Records: All interactions within TalkingParents are stored to Unalterable Records that are trusted by legal professionals and accepted in courtrooms nationwide. Each Record includes a Digital Signature and unique 16-digit Authentication Code that verifies the Record is genuine and has not been modified in any way. PDF and Printed Records are available for Secure Messaging, Accountable Calling, Shared Calendar, Accountable Payments, Info Library, and Personal Journal. FAQs: Do I have to be on the same plan as my co-parent? No, you can communicate through TalkingParents no matter what plan your co-parent is on. We offer four different plans—Free, Essentials, Enhanced, or Ultimate. (Free users do not have access to the mobile app.) Is TalkingParents court-monitored? No, though Unalterable Records are court-admissible and can be used as evidence in family law cases, no one monitors interactions between you and your co-parent. This is for the privacy of our users. Can I change plans? Yes, TalkingParents offers monthly subscriptions that make it easy to modify your plan at any time. If you don’t think your needs will change throughout the year, we also offer annual plans that include a 16% discount. Can my account be deleted? No, TalkingParents does not allow the deletion of accounts once created and matched. This ensures that neither co-parent can remove an account and clear messages, call records, or other details within the service. https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

Requests and payments are timestamped, and you can also schedule monthly recurring payments. Info Library: Share important details about the kids with customizable cards that both parents can access without having to contact each other. This feature is a great place to store frequently used information like clothing sizes, medical information, and more. Personal Journal: Keep private notes about thoughts and interactions you want recorded for later. Whether it’s in-person discussions with your co-parent or child behavior observances, journal entries are just for you and can include up to five attachments. Vault File Storage: Store photos, videos, and important documents. Your Vault cannot be accessed by your co-parent, but you may choose to share files with any third party by copying or emailing a link, which can be set to expire. You can also download files to your device. Unalterable Records: All interactions within TalkingParents are stored to Unalterable Records that are trusted by legal professionals and accepted in courtrooms nationwide. Each Record includes a Digital Signature and unique 16-digit Authentication Code that verifies the Record is genuine and has not been modified in any way. PDF and Printed Records are available for Secure Messaging, Accountable Calling, Shared Calendar, Accountable Payments, Info Library, and Personal Journal. FAQs: Do I have to be on the same plan as my co-parent? No, you can communicate through TalkingParents no matter what plan your co-parent is on. We offer four different plans—Free, Essentials, Enhanced, or Ultimate. (Free users do not have access to the mobile app.) Is TalkingParents court-monitored? No, though Unalterable Records are court-admissible and can be used as evidence in family law cases, no one monitors interactions between you and your co-parent. This is for the privacy of our users. Can I change plans? Yes, TalkingParents offers monthly subscriptions that make it easy to modify your plan at any time. If you don’t think your needs will change throughout the year, we also offer annual plans that include a 16% discount. Can my account be deleted? No, TalkingParents does not allow the deletion of accounts once created and matched. This ensures that neither co-parent can remove an account and clear messages, call records, or other details within the service. https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

Unfortunately, lots of software makes it worse by over-complicating things. Basecamp’s different. What makes Basecamp special? It’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management. Basecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together. Basecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone.",

      "description": "OurFamilyWizard is the #1 co-parenting app trusted by courts and family law professionals across all 50 states in the US, as well as Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The app has been featured in the New York Times, Parents.com, Verywell Family, NPR, WIRED, the Today Show, and more. OurFamilyWizard makes co-parenting easier. We designed these tools to help you reduce conflict, so your kids can thrive after a separation or a divorce. With our powerful and customizable tools, you can free up time, emotional energy, and mental space. With all your digital co-parenting interactions rolled up in one secure app, you can keep everything organized and documented. Plus, you can shield your kids from adult conversations they don’t need to see. NEW: STAY CONNECTED THROUGH CALLS • Stay close when you’re apart When you miss your child or they miss you, give them an audio or video call. • Connect virtually Calls offer an easy solution for virtual visitation, midweek visits, or long-distance co-parenting. *Currently, the calls feature is only available to users located in the United States. • Automatic documentation With Calls, the details are documented: all dates, times, and in-call activity. All in the same place as your other co-parenting communications. SIMPLIFY COMMUNICATION • Use just one app No more searching for messages or attachments across DMs, phone calls, texts, and emails. Just use one secure app. • Track the truth Once you send a message, it’s permanent. First-viewed timestamps mean no more arguing about who said what, when, or whether it was seen. • Communicate calmly ToneMeter AI catches language that could escalate conflict and offers suggestions on how to rewrite your message. COORDINATE YOUR CALENDAR • Create a parenting time schedule (or custody schedule) The color-coded schedule shows what’s coming up, including events, holidays, and drop-offs/pick-ups. • Encourage reliability When everyone shares the same Calendar, mix-ups are a thing of the past. • Schedule Change Requests Need to make a one-time change to the schedule? Adjust the Calendar with an easy form. STREAMLINE YOUR EXPENSES • Simplify the math Keep clear, secure records of your co-parenting expenses and receipts. • Customize categories Create new categories, with your own percentage splits. • Centralize everything With OFWpay, you can reimburse your co-parent in the app—and you can even make scheduled payments for child support. (Or record payments via another method.) KEEP A MEANINGFUL JOURNAL • Log when you arrive Verify your presence at drop-offs and pick-ups with GPS Check-Ins. • Capture memories Record parenting observations and special, close moments with photos and text. SHARE INFO ABOUT YOUR KIDS • Store essential details Share and view medical records, clothing sizes, school information, and more. • Minimize messaging No need to message your co-parent for basic stuff—just check the Info Bank. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTS If you need to go to court or mediation, quick and simple documentation will make your life easier. It only takes a couple minutes on the website to customize and download a report from any app feature. GRANT YOUR PROS ACCESS With your permission and a Practitioner Account, your family law pro can view all app activity, help you manage the practical details, and quickly download reports—which potentially reduces your legal fees. Available for: Lawyers Mediators Parenting coordinators Guardians ad litem Therapists KEEP EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE OurFamilyWizard helps you coordinate with your co-parent, but you can also add accounts for your kids and anyone involved in childcare.

      "description": "During the most critical moments in life, Pulsara® places the power in your hands to build teams and communicate with public safety, public health, and emergency management on the fly. Pulsara unites distributed teams—first responders, emergency medical services, fire departments, hospitals, health systems, behavioral health experts, emergency management, and more—on one scalable communication and logistics platform. From the routine EMS transport to a mass casualty incident, Pulsara’s flexible platform enables teams to standardize workflows and streamline communications for every method of arrival and patient or event type. The result? Decreased treatment times, providers who are empowered to provide better quality of care, reduced provider burnout, and cost and resource savings. In an age when smartphones and mobile technology are used for just about everything, many health systems rely on fax machines, pagers, two-way radios, landline phone calls, and even sticky notes to coordinate patient care. Vital information often falls through the cracks, leading to wasted resources, delayed treatments, decreased quality of care, and billions of dollars lost annually due to medical errors. Unlike other solutions that only connect people within the four walls of their own facility or organization, Pulsara can connect ANYONE from ANYWHERE for ANY condition or event, enabling true systems of care that scale. Purpose-built to improve the lives of people in need and those who serve them, Pulsara streamlines all logistics and communication around patient events. Simply CREATE a dedicated patient channel. BUILD the team. And COMMUNICATE & TRACK using audio, live video, instant messaging, data, images, and key benchmarks, all using the devices you and your teams know and love. You can add a new organization, team, or individual to any encounter, dynamically building a care team as the patient condition and location evolve. And when disaster strikes, Pulsara scales to manage incidents and events, allowing your teams to use the same familiar platform to respond to major incidents the same way they would a routine call. No matter what the situation is, Pulsara connects the right people at the right time, around every patient. At Pulsara, we live by the phrase “It’s About People.” We see our customers as partners in a journey committed to improving the lives of every person they serve. By leveraging innovative communication features through the Pulsara platform, customers across the globe have improved patient outcomes, including: * In Texas, a hospital decreased the time it takes for stroke patients to receive tPA by 59%, dropping from an average of 110 minutes to 46 minutes * In an Australian health system, the ambulance routinely bypasses the emergency department to take patients directly to CT in 7 minutes on average, down 68% from a 22-minute average * A health system in Arkansas treated STEMI patients in an average of 63 minutes, a 19% decrease in just 4 months * An EMS agency in Texas used Pulsara to power their ET3 program and in just 3 weeks, prevented 434 low-acuity patients from needing to go to the hospital * An EMS agency in Texas reported that when using Pulsara for a full-scale crisis exercise, they had 100% accountability for all patients transported Connected teams have the power to achieve incredible results by bringing the focus back to what matters most: people. ================================== PULSARA® is a registered trademark and service mark of CommuniCare Technology, Inc. d/b/a Pulsara in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

      "description": "Weave Chat AAC is a free, dynamic, and completely customizable AAC app that is available to a variety of devices. Weave Chat AAC offers a large variety of verbs (green), pronouns (yellow), questions (purple), nouns (tan/orange), adjectives (blue), and conversational words (pink). All color choices were made based on the Fitzgerald Key and new vocabulary is added weekly. Users can add their own custom images and categories in Settings —> Manage Custom Images. In addition, users can add their own custom phrases that can easily be accessed from their board; to add phrases, go to Settings —> Manage Phrases. Users can select a synthetic voice (dependent on their device settings) from Settings —> Change Voice Settings - here you can select your voice, vocal pitch, and rate of speech. Image and text size can be personalized from Settings —> Change Image & Text Size (select from default - small, medium, and large). Settings —> Configure Image Keyboard allows the user to turn on/off features that allow for the category text to be read aloud (synthetic voice for categories), to keep the user in the category after a image has been selected (stay on category after image selection), and disable the speech output for individual words so that it only reads aloud when the white text screen is touched (synthetic voice disabled for individual words). The AAC board can be modified in Settings —> Manage Board Builder. Here, the user can select from the default board (you must make a copy to edit it - to do this select “Add new keyboard” and then select “Hide Images” for Type of Keyboard); grid position boards (ranging in size from 1x2 - 7x15 rows/columns); and Board Builder (gives you the option to build a board from scratch). All boards are completely editable and all custom images and categories can be used from all boards. Lastly, Manage Pin Configuration allows the user to set a pin over all (or just some) aspects of customization to lock down features as needed. Feature List: - Dynamic, customizable, AAC boards - Large variety of verbs, nouns, and adjectives with additional vocabulary added weekly - Add custom images and custom categories - Create and save phrases - Select a synthetic voice (as available per your device settings) - Copy & Paste AAC picture icon messages via “share” - Create and/or modify AAC boards via 3 options: grid position boards (ranging from 1x2 - 7x15), hide images, and/or create a new board from scratch - “Text” others who have the app using AAC picture icons - Set a passcode to lock down features as needed - Weave Chat AAC currently only has English buttons/images",

      "description": "Everyone knows email is messy, chat is noisy, social media is spyware, and single-purpose apps are exhausting. It doesn’t have to be this way. At GroupSpot, we’ve built the ultimate group communications platform optimized for community, utility, and privacy. Groups have all the tools they need to succeed in a single solution, whether it’s a small circle of friends or a town sports league. When it comes to group communications, you won’t find a platform with more flexibility and efficiency than GroupSpot. Here’s a few groups using GroupSpot today: Families Share meaningful moments and big wins with the wider family. You now have a home for all those moments only your cousins would care about: curtain call at the grade school play, mom crossing the finish line in the local 5k, and dad’s epic fail on the trampoline. In between, GroupSpot ensures you’re on top of Family Birthdays, Graduations, and Anniversaries. Community Groups Be a hometown hero and bring your local community into the 21st century with GroupSpot. Replace the color-coded weekly email blasts and clunky web signups with a single platform solution. Watch as engagement skyrockets simply because it’s easier to access and participate. This includes HSAs/PTAs, Newcomers, Non-Profits, Rotary Clubs, and other Community Groups. Book Clubs Unlike other book club apps looking to sell you books or collect your data, GroupSpot’s only interest is your Book Club. We make your monthly meetings great by sharing important details like discussion topics, RSVP, and host messages. We’ve also created a home for your past books where you can access, rate, and review any book ever read by your Book Club. Teams We provide all the bells and whistles you’ve come to expect with team apps like schedules, games, rosters, directions, and player availability. But GroupSpot is also great for casual groups like pickup soccer when all you care about is having enough players to field a game. Or teams that compete outside the playing field like academic teams and marching bands. Faith Groups Make your engagement with your House of Worship more than a once-a-week event by staying better connected through GroupSpot. Share inspirational scripture, preview the upcoming sermon, organize potluck dinners, plan the perfect retreat, support those in need, and more. GroupSpot also has advanced features for the engineer in all of us: • Mass Communications: Email, Pushes, In-App Alerts • Personal and Group Chat • Shared Photo Albums • Signups, Polls, Forms, RSVPs, Links, Attachments • Games, Schedules, Rosters, and Player Availability for Teams • Meetings, Books, Discussions Topics, Ratings, and Reviews for Book Clubs • Advanced Member Management • Subgroups and Sister Group Management And much more… About GroupSpot GroupSpot is working hard to become a leader in the group communications space. But behind those lofty ambitions, you’ll find real purpose. At its core, GroupSpot was designed with a single, guiding principle in mind, protecting your privacy. When you have a subscription model, there’s no incentive to mine someone’s personal data or keep them glued to their screen. We will never, ever, invade your privacy. We’ve built a privacy-first, group communications platform because we believe there is a growing number of groups who share our passion. We believe in smarter communications, ones shaped by ethical tech and social responsibility. When it comes to group communications, there are plenty of choices, but none that rival GroupSpot in purpose and design.

It is a secure messaging tool designed to make working life easier and more productive for work-groups. Why Crait? The simple answer is: Businesses need to protect their digital assets.

      "description": "Learn Communication Skills A decade-and-a-half later, with the rise of social media networking and texting, communication is becoming more casual, even in situations where more formal ways of communicating are required. What this means is that people from the younger generation, may not know or even understand the importance of effective communication skills in the workplace. When you take a look at the greatest leaders, one of the traits they possess, is the ability to communicate effectively, which underscores the importance of communication skills. Alpha Z Studio provides you communication skills app in which you will learn how to communicate with people in a good way. More details are given below. types of communication Your communication skills will fall under four categories of communication. Let's take a closer look at each area. 1. Written communication Writing is one of the more traditional aspects of communication. We often write as part of our job, communicating via email and messenger apps like Slack, as well as in more formal documents, like project reports and white papers. Conveying information clearly, concisely, and with an accurate tone of voice are all important parts of written communication. 2. Verbal communication Communicating verbally is how many of us share information in the workplace. This can be informal, such as chatting with coworkers about an upcoming deliverable, or more formal, such as meeting with your manager to discuss your performance. 3. Non-verbal communication The messages you communicate to others can also take place non-verbally—through your body language, eye contact, and overall demeanor. You can cultivate strong non-verbal communication by using appropriate facial expressions, nodding, and making good eye contact. Really, verbal communication and body language must be in sync to convey a message clearly. 4. Visual communication Lastly, visual communication means using images, graphs, charts, and other non-written means to share information. Often, visuals may accompany a piece of writing or stand alone. In either case, it's a good idea to make sure your visuals are clear and strengthen what you're sharing. Why Is Effective Communication Important? Effective communication is vital both in and out of the workplace because it allows you to clearly translate your intentions and feelings into easily understandable messages. Effective communication makes you a more productive worker and cuts down on unintended consequences that arise as a result of miscommunication. Developing an effective communication process helps you understand what others are saying and makes you a better collaborator and team member. Developing advanced communication skills begins with simple interactions. Communication skills can be practiced every day in settings that range from the social to the professional. New skills take time to refine, but each time you use your communication skills, you open yourself to opportunities and future partnerships. If you like our app then please give us 5 star ratings. we are trying our best to make the learning process more easy and simple for you.",

BAND for Kids is a safe space for adolescents to interact within a private social platform, while allowing parents and guardians to moderate activity. ◆ Easy to get started: - Kids can get started by following these three steps: 1) Download BAND for Kids app to a mobile phone or tablet. 2) Use an email address to sign up (parent consent is required). 3) Join a private Band by parents or guardian invitation. ◆ How parents and kids communicate together safely: - Kids cannot join groups they were NOT invited to. - Parents can monitor which group their kids have joined. - Parents can follow their children’s BAND activity by also joining their groups. ◆ Safer environment for kids to communicate: - No harassment from strangers. - No advertisements and in-app purchases. - Kids cannot create or invite themselves to Bands/Pages. - Kids cannot search or join public Bands. ◆ Available features for kids: - Admin of the Band can determine which features are available to the Kids users. - With BAND for Kids, adolescent users can publish posts on the Community Board and attach files, images, or videos to the posts. They can also chat with other members of their Bands. ◆ Accessibility: - BAND for Kids is available on any device including smart phones, tablets, and PC. ◆ Private and Secure - BAND has acquired the SOC 2 and 3 certificates for its privacy protection and ISO/IEC27001 Certification for outstanding information security management systems.",
