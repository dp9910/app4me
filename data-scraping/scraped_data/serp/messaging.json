      "description": "Signal is a messaging app with privacy at its core. It is free and easy to use, with strong end-to-end encryption that keeps your communication completely private. • Send texts, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs, and files for free. Signal uses your phone’s data connection, so you avoid SMS and MMS fees. • Call your friends with crystal-clear encrypted voice and video calls. Group calls supported for up to 50 people. • Stay connected with group chats up to 1,000 people. Control who can post and manage group members with admin permission settings. • Share image, text, and video Stories that disappear after 24 hours. Privacy settings keep you in charge of exactly who can see each Story. • Signal is built for your privacy. We know nothing about you or who you’re talking to. Our open source Signal Protocol means that we can’t read your messages or listen to your calls. Neither can anyone else. No back doors, no data collection, no compromises. • Signal is independent and not for profit; a different kind of tech from a different kind of organization.

      "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users. FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe. SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again. UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork. RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs. SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it. PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads. For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient. We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

And if it DOES happen again, the app will clear any unnecessary notifications on the next Discord app launch. The following issues have also been cleaned up: - Sharing multiple images to Discord via the Share Sheet should now preserve the order of images properly. - Fixed multi-image embeds only showing the last image, as if you only heard a joke’s punchline before the rest of it. - Resolved an issue where the Camera Flip button wouldn’t function properly... although it still doesn’t make your phone do a backflip. As always, see what else we’ve been cookin’ (or, I guess, uncooked?) over at dis.gd/PatchNotes",

      "description": "Speak freely with Confide. With our encrypted messenger app, your mobile communications will be completely confidential and have the same level of privacy as the spoken word. You’ll leave zero trace online with end-to-end encrypted messaging, vanishing messages, screenshot-proof technology, and Incognito Mode. You can even send retractable messages or use our line-by-line text reader. Over 350 million encrypted messages have already been delivered safely and self-destructed with the help of Confide, while the patented ScreenshieldKit technology prevented more than 7.9K screenshot attempts. Here's what you get with Confide: ENCRYPTED MESSAGING Send private texts and sensitive data with end-to-end encryption. (Your data is never saved on our servers.) DISAPPEARING MESSAGES Turn on Confidential Mode, and your messages will disappear after they’re read. Want to keep them for the day? Turn off Confidential Mode. Regardless, all messages will disappear automatically 24 hours after being sent. VANISHING iMESSAGES Confide’s highly-rated iMessage plugin does what no other technology can: erases your iMessages during any conversation. With Confide, you can compose and send self-destructive messages via iMessage. SCREENSHOT PREVENTION Confide’s patented technology ensures messages cannot be screenshotted by their recipients. Passports, credit cards, personal docs, and sensitive messages stay protected. PRIVATE AND GROUP MESSAGING Enjoy all of the privacy perks of this secret text app, like anonymous text, safe chat, and private texting – whether you’re 1-to-1 messaging or using group chat. THREADED CONVERSATIONS Add a layer of security to group texts. Quickly start a thread within the chat experience to keep the momentum going – without disrupting an ongoing group chat conversation. INCOGNITO MODE Stay anonymous. Unlike other encrypted messenger apps that announce when a new user has joined, Incognito Mode ensures you become undiscoverable to the people you don’t want to be seen by. RETRACT UNREAD MESSAGES Make private messaging even more private with the option to unsend unread messages. Change your mind? Retract! ADDITIONAL FEATURES: * Create nicknames for your contacts * Switch themes AVAILABLE ON MOBILE AND DESKTOP Use an anonymous chat, encrypted messaging, safe chat, private text, and Confide’s other features on the go or closer or on your computer. Everyone deserves their privacy. Confide is perfect for professionals in the financial, political, journalism, and legal fields – because conversations are safe, and they don’t leave a paper trail. The Confide app has been used by thousands of people around the globe and been featured by The New York Times, TechCrunch, and many more. Join the Confide community today!

A combination of factors is used to determine excessive use, including but not limited to the relative use when compared to the average magicJack® user, the number of unique numbers called, calls forwarded, minutes used, texts sent/received and other factors. Unlimited calling does not include calls to Alaska or the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada or calls to non-8YY calling card, platform, conference, or chat lines, for which additional fees will apply.

Mass Email, SMS and Social Media in just one app, with just one message! ------------------------- KEY FEATURES ---------------------------------- - Powerful marketing tool for business or personal usage - One text message for all recipient types. Write just once! - Supports multiple messaging services (Email, Social media, SMS/MMS/iMessage) (Note that the text services are configured on your phone Settings > Messages) - Bulk texting to groups or individuals - Custom templates. Create and reuse messages! - Advanced settings for contacts and groups management! - Support for multiple image attachments! - Use multiple messaging services at once! - Includes birthday reminders! - Messages scheduler for later delivery! (via notifications) - Reach multiple recipient types (with different contact info on the address book) at once: You can write just 1 message and send it to a group or individuals, even if some are email contacts, other phone numbers, both, etc, depending on the app settings. Just select \"Use both services\" on the app settings and the app will know how to reach them all. - Import of iCloud groups - Dark mode support - Unlimited messages * - Quick recipients selection mode and group management - Easily create/update/delete contacts, groups and template messages - Useful help tooltips - Available FAQ & Video Tutorial (English only) ----------------------------- HOW IT WORKS---------------------------------- Send messages to groups or everyone you know, typing the message just once. Reach all your contacts by Email, SMS/MMS/iMessage, and/or post to social networks (Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn) at the same time, at once. No need to write separate messages or use different software/media. Just confirm and send! Use built-in common messages or create custom ones. Archive them for future usage if you're lazy. Manage your contacts and create custom groups to speedup messaging. Easy Message is even clever enough to know how each contact should be reached Add recipients to you message just by selecting them Create new groups or update existing ones, just by selecting multiple contacts ----------------------- REQUIREMENTS ---------------------- This app requires IOS 9 or later. ------------------------- NOTES ------------------------------- Note: On iPad you can only send messages via Email or iMessage (since SMS/MMS is not available on iPad devices due to the lack of a SIM card) * On phones, if you want undisclosed recipients and not a group text you must use plain SMS (these services must be configured on your phone Settings -> Messages). When doing this, remember that some mobile operators might limit the number of your recipients, and having too many recipients may cause failure in your recipients receiving your messages. In addition, always make sure your selected recipients have valid phone numbers. ------------------------------------------------------------- FAQ (English only) available here: https://pcdreamsapps.wixsite.com/easymessage/faq Good looking icons by: Glyphish, glyphish.com CrazEriC, http://crazeric.deviantart.com/ Lenka Meleakova, http://www.profimagazin.cz Visual Pharm, http://www.visualpharm.com Zen Nikki - http://zen-nikki.deviantart.com/",

Stars Messenger Kids lets you safely message, call, and group video chat with your family and friends without any phone number, strangers, or ads. On most messaging platforms, once your phone number or username is publicly discovered, you are no longer in control of who can contact you.

With the ability to reset your Friend Code, you are always in control of who can connect with you. All group chats are also protected with a unique group code. Parents can also optionally enable Parent View for their child. Parent View allows you the ability to see who your child is friends with, the groups they're in, their time spent on Stars, and more. You'll receive notifications in real time upon your child's activity. Stars Messenger Kids isn’t just safe, it’s super fun too: Customizable message styles with a range of fonts, colors, and sizes Cool emojis!

FAQ: Q: What is a Friend Code? A: On Stars, your Friend Code is your unique randomly generated code that you should only give out to the people that you want to be added by on Stars. You can reset this for a new randomly generated code at any time. To add a friend on Stars, you will need to ask them for their username and friend code, and to be added on Stars, they will need your username and friend code. Q: I don’t want to talk to someone anymore on Stars. What should I do? A: Step one is to delete the person you no longer want to talk to. After you delete the person from your contacts, you will be prompted to reset your Friend Code - this way, the person you have blocked will have no way to add you again. All done! This is unlike a phone number, email, or public username, which you cannot just easily change to avoid someone. Q: Can I decline add requests? A: Yes! On Stars, you must first accept add requests first for that person to be able to message you. If you don’t know the person, or don’t want to talk to them, you can decline the request.

Set the due date 5. You'll get notified, press send, done. Kyew (pronounced \"Q\" as in cue) will save your message, including any attachments, and send you a notification at the scheduled time. Upon opening the notification, your pre-composed message will be ready to send in one tap. You can set up a recurring schedule to send text messages daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. This is ideal for both personal and business use. GROUP TEXT & MASS MESSAGES Send individual text messages to multiple people. You can create and manage groups within the app, or import from your contacts. This is a terrific function that allows you to write a message once and dispatch it to an entire group individually without creating a group chat. It's similar to BCC'ing a group of contacts in an email. FOR PERSONAL USE * Birthdays & anniversaries * Remember important days * Stay in touch with old friends * Invitations * Count-down reminders (e.g. \"10 days until Hawaii\") * Etc. FOR BUSINESS USE Did you know that 98% of texts are opened, and most of them are read within 5 minutes? Texting is indispensable for your business, and Kyew is your trusted texting tool. * Appointment reminders * Renewal/Expiration notices * Follow-ups * Content-promotion * Customer-relationship management * Etc.

      "description": "Carrier is the best way to schedule messages. **Note:** For your privacy, it is not possible to send messages on your behalf without you taking action. You have to push send when you get the notification. Don't forget! ## Why I created this Asking Siri to remind you to send someone a message only helps if you can remember what you wanted to say. After forgetting one too many times to send an important message, I decided to make an app to help me out. Now I can write and schedule the message when I think of it and send it at just the right time. ## How it works Just as when sending a regular text message, you select a person and write your message. Then you choose the date and time for the message to send. When the time comes, you will get a notification that will allow you to send the message. It integrates with the built-in Messages app, so it comes from you in your normal conversations. ## Contacts If you choose to give Carrier access to your contacts, it is effortless to select a recipient for your message. Rest assured that your contacts are not harvested or shared with anyone—it just makes your life easier. If you do not give access, you can still select a recipient. ## Groups When you choose multiple recipients for a message, you will be prompted to create a group to make it easier to message those people again. You can manage your groups in Settings at any time. ## Dark theme A gorgeous dark theme makes writing and scheduling messages in low light easy on your eyes. And with automatic switching from light to dark themes, you can always have the best experience for the moment. ## Pro upgrade Carrier is free to use for a limited number of messages each month. When you upgrade to Carrier Pro, you will unlock unlimited messages, the ability to use your voice to create and schedule messages, and help support continued development. Thanks! ## Family project As I have worked on this app, my kids have contributed lots of ideas for features. My eleven-year-old daughter thought of many of the Easter eggs, and hopes you will enjoy finding them. We hope this will be as much help for you as it has been for us! -Ben",

Here’s a shortlist of our features: - Complete anonymity for sign up: no phone number, contacts, email address, last four of your social and credit card CVC code, blood type, etc. Just agree on a channel name or find each other by username. - Deleting messages deletes for all parties.

LoopMessage offers great user data privacy: - App stores all data only on your device, without using external servers. - You can deny access to the phone book and use only internal contacts in the app. Thus, your personal contacts will not be known to the app. - If you have allowed access to the phone book, the app will work only in Read-only mode with your Phone Book. The app will never make changes to the Phone Book since the main goal of the application is to distribute messages without making changes in contacts. What are the benefits of using LoopMessage for bulk distribution? - By sending messages via iMessage, your customers will receive authentic blue chat bubble messages with modern previews. - You can send a message via iMessage by specifying the recipient's e-mail. If he has an iCloud account created on this mail, he will also receive a message. - If you need to send messages to recipients in different countries, now you don't have to worry about roaming for SMS, since messaging via iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Threema does not depend on your cellular provider. Who using our product? - iOS/macOS-only app owners. This way, they have a 100% relevant audience of users who already have iMessage installed. For other platforms, they can send messages via WhatsApp or Telegram. - People who provide personalized services and need to be in touch with their clients. For example, teachers, fitness trainers, consultants are those who need to constantly stay in touch with their audience and send messages every day. Previously these people spent several hours a day on messaging, but now they can do it in 5 minutes. - Business owners who are constantly trying to notify their customers about product updates, new sales, and promotions, or any other event that may be of interest to their audience.
