      "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED Hinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it’s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada. HOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE When it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. Here’s how: * We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you. * We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more. * We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile. * We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are. * We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future. The app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.

      "description": "Mighty has more $1M communities than any other platform. Why? Because it’s the only community software designed to introduce your members to each other and help them connect. Those member to member interactions are ultimately what will make your courses, challenges, events and memberships successful. Mighty powers them using its proprietary People Magic AI, which is designed to surface the most interesting and relevant members to each other and help them break the ice. On Mighty, a creator, entrepreneur, coach or community leader can host groups and subgroups, offer courses, livestream, run events, and more.

Those member to member interactions are ultimately what will make your courses, challenges, events and memberships successful. Mighty powers them using its proprietary People Magic AI, which is designed to surface the most interesting and relevant members to each other and help them break the ice. On Mighty, a creator, entrepreneur, coach or community leader can host groups and subgroups, offer courses, livestream, run events, and more.

It's simple. You tell us about your interests, goals, and professional experience. Our AI connects you to our global (and local!) community for a 1:1 chat, audio or video call. If you want to reconnect, we'll help you with that too. We believe that the right connections can advance careers, transform lives, and even change the world—and we’re building the future of networking to make those connections possible.

      "description": "Introducing the \"Business Network App\" – a dedicated tool designed for BNI Members and Leadership Teams (LT), aiming to revolutionize the way you manage your chapters. This innovative mobile platform is geared towards enhancing productivity, simplifying management tasks, and promoting increased visibility within the BNI community. The app is optimized to keep you connected, organized, and updated – all in real-time. The Business Network App shines as a beacon of efficiency, dramatically reducing the need for manual operations involved in chapter management. It is the ideal solution for LT members looking to streamline their administrative tasks and focus more on building stronger connections within their chapters. The BNI App brings a transformative approach to managing weekly meetings by automating the attendance logs. Say goodbye to the cumbersome, traditional attendance system. With our app, BNI Members can automatically record their attendance at weekly meetings. The intelligent system marks attendance as present, absent, late, or substitute, saving these logs for future reference. This automation not only saves precious time but also aids in improving attendance discipline among members. Members can review their attendance log at any time, helping them plan their schedules in advance and ensuring maximum visibility within their chapters. This is the efficiency that a BNI Mobile App brings to the table! Communication within the chapter is made seamless with this app. Members can effortlessly reach out to the LT team and Co-ordinator team with a simple tap. With the integrated connectivity options, you can connect through WhatsApp or a phone call, ensuring that support is just a tap away. The BNI App also functions as a comprehensive member directory. Keep track of your fellow members, effortlessly find and connect with them, and update your contact information as and when needed. This feature serves as a digital Rolodex, keeping the BNI community closer than ever. Personalization is another hallmark of the Business Network App. Members can update their personal details, allowing them to highlight the services or businesses they provide. This feature ensures your profile is always up-to-date, complete with your contact information, bio, and other relevant details. This promotes transparency and helps foster stronger bonds within the BNI community. The BNI Mobile App also revolutionizes the way members manage their product and service details. Members can autonomously update their weekly presentations, eliminating the dependence on the slide coordinator or meeting host. Upload up to 5 images and manage your weekly presentation screen with ease. The app also allows you to add specific asks to include in the presentation screen, ensuring every presentation is tailored to your needs. In essence, the Business Network App is designed to foster a connected BNI community. With features like the member directory, personal details, and leadership team, it becomes effortless to find and connect with other members. The BNI App is not just about management, it's about growth, networking, and community. Experience the future of BNI today! Disclaimer: The Business Network App is not an official BNI Mobile App. It is an independently developed platform designed to aid BNI Chapter's Leadership Teams in managing their chapters more effectively and efficiently. This app functions as a comprehensive tool for enhancing productivity, connectivity, and transparency within the BNI community. However, it should not be confused with an official application from BNI. All BNI-related terminologies and references are used under the context of this app's functionality and its intended use for BNI Members and Leadership Teams.",

      "description": "Third Wheel is a smarter way to meet the right people—without the awkward search. It combines location-aware discovery with an AI recommender (think ChatGPT for networking) to help you find high-value connections and start better conversations, faster. What you can do: 1. Discover people nearby: See real profiles around you (events, campuses, co-working spaces). Filter by interests and connect in a tap. 2. Get AI recommendations: Describe who you want to meet—“tech founders,” “classmates in climate,” “mentors in product ops”—and our AI suggests tailored profiles to reach out to, with conversation starters. 3. Reach out with context: View rich profiles, shared interests, and suggested prompts so every message feels natural and relevant. Why it’s different: 1. Signal over noise: We pre-filter profiles and then use an AI layer to rank for fit—so you spend time meeting people, not scrolling. 2. Built for students & early-career pros: Perfect for orientations, conferences, recruiting seasons, and new cities. 3. Privacy-first: Location is used to show nearby results when you choose to enable it. You control what you share, and you can limit visibility or turn location off anytime. Getting started: 1. Create your profile. 2. Enable Nearby to explore who’s around—or tell the AI recommender who you’re looking for. 3. Send a thoughtful message with an AI-suggested opener and make the connection.",

Networkr is a business relationship building platform designed to help you grow new local relationships by making sure you are always meeting new people at various networking events, through introductions, and groups found in the app. Networkr takes into account a lot of factors, such as using industry and demographics information to help you meet more people. Networkr uses a level scale from 0-4 to tell how well you know someone and to help you grow your relationships. The levels are: 0 - Peer (Someone you haven't met) 1 - Someone you Met 2 - Someone you Know 3 - Someone you Know & Trust 4 - Raving Fan and Friend When you attend an event or check-in to a location using our map, Networkr connects you to everyone at the event will become a Level 0, and those at your table will become a Level 1. The app will help you take your level 1 relationships to level 2 by finding recommended times to meet with those you have recently met. When new relationships become level 2 (Know & Trust), you will start to see your business grow. You can keep in touch with everyone you meet via the social features of our app. If you’d like more visitors going to your Networking event.

Whether you're looking for business partners, clients, investors, or peers, Met makes networking more efficient by introducing you to the right people—live, in-person, at the event or spontaneously at the venues you work from. Nothing is pre-arranged. Met works in real-time, only in specific locations, allowing you to make meaningful connections as opportunities arise. Beyond events, you can also use Met to connect with people at coworking spaces, cafes, or airport lounges, helping you build both professional and social relationships in the spaces you frequent. Instead of navigating large crowds or making cold introductions, Met helps you connect with curated matches, eliminating the awkwardness of the approach. Find friends, network and make lifetime connections wherever you are. How It Works: Turn Visibility On – Met is location-based and works only when you're at an event or a supported venue. Create Your Role Cards – Define who you are and who you're looking to meet. Get AI-Powered Suggestions – Instantly see relevant people nearby based on mutual interests and goals. Send an Invite and Start a Conversation – Once accepted, a chat opens so you can coordinate where to meet. Privacy First – While chatting, your visibility automatically turns off so you can focus on the conversation. Keep the Connection Going – Share contact info if you want to stay in touch. Make the most of every event and workspace with smarter, more meaningful connections—live and in real time. Download Met and start networking with purpose.",
