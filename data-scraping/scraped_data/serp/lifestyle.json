      "description": "How many negative thoughts have been endlessly repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day. Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances. As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day. There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine: - They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back. - Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. - They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head.

We decide our habits and our habits decide our future.” Eden is your new habits tracker companion app. It helps you create and maintain your daily habits and goals. ============== What set it apart? ============== For each day you complete your tasks, you will grow a flower little by little. As long as you keep your habits, you will grow a garden and fill it with flowers! It is designed to be a relaxing, non-stressful app that encourages you to make small steps everyday and progress at your own pace. ============== How does it work? ============== ◆ Create your daily habits, tasks or goals you wish to achieve every day. ◆ Each day, if you mark them all as achieved, a plant will flower, step by step. ◆ However, if you don’t achieve your tasks, a part of the flower will fade away. ◆ Each day, your tasks are automatically refreshed (to do again). ◆ As long as you take care of you, you will take care of your garden. ============== What else? ============== ◆ A simple, clean, minimalist design. ◆ Very simple to use. ◆ Reminder and timer to help you focus. ◆ Widget to put your garden on your home screen. ◆ No fancy graphics or complex statistics. Focus on today and what you want to accomplish. ◆ Images, ambient sounds & music for you to customize your app. ◆ You can use the app freely to grow your first flower. Get the premium version to grow them all. ============== And one more thing. ============== What we do and repeat everyday eventually defines what we are and what life we live. With the right habits, it is quite simple (but never easy) to bring balance, harmony, satisfaction and discipline in our life. Habits are not only things we do with our hands and feet, but also our mind: what we think about, how often we express gratitude or make compliments. With this in mind, we wish you a happy life, and if our app helped you along the way, stop by to say \"Hello\". :) *** If you have any question, suggestion or feedback, please email us at hello@millefeuille.agency.

With HealthBit, tracking your vital signs has never been easier. The app allows you to monitor key health indicators such as pulse, blood sugar, blood pressure, oxygen levels, body temperature, and weight, while providing long-term trend analysis. You can also log your daily calorie intake and consult AI health advisors to enhance your overall health. For more accurate insights, we recommend taking multiple readings throughout the day—especially upon waking, before bed, and after exercise. HealthBit makes this process simple and its accuracy has been validated through professional testing. Key Features: Track daily calorie intake Monitor your pulse anytime during the day Keep track of trends in heart rate and other vital signs Log your blood sugar, blood pressure, oxygen level, weight and body temperature Export personal health reports to share Take heart risk assessments and MBTI personality tests Meditate with guided sessions and get healthy eating advice How to Use: HealthBit is easy to use with just your phone. Place your finger on the back camera, remain still, and start measuring your pulse. Wait for the result once the process completes. Important Information: HealthBit is intended for fitness purposes only and is not a substitute for medical devices or advice. It provides general health insights but cannot be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. The app does not measure blood pressure, oxygen level, or body temperature.

      "description": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app. Along with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time. Through our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you. **The I Am Sober app features:** • Sober day tracker To visualize how long you’ve been sober. • Remember why you quit Add reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober. • Daily pledge tracker Take a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day. • Sobriety calculator View how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober. • Analyze triggers Recap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last. • Share your story Either with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself. • Milestone tracker Track and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice. • Withdrawal timeline When you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery. • Customize your experience You set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs. **Sober Plus subscriptions** I Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features: • Create a group Stay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center. • Locked access Keep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID. • Data Backups Save your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device. • More tracking Track more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more. Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.
