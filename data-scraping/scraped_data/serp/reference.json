      "description": "Classic Words is the best word game to play against your iPhone or iPad (solitaire mode). Scrabble for victory and enrich your vocabulary thanks to the built-in word definitions! 6 languages are supported: English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Dutch. Tired of stumbling across cheaters or waiting for hours for your online opponent to play in multiplayer games? Try out Classic Words for instant fun, no matter if you are a beginner in crossword games or a tournament player! Choose the difficulty level (from beginner to expert), pick a word list, and use your strategy skills and vocabulary to try and defeat the iPhone. The English word lists included in the game are inspired by the official lists used in Scrabble tournaments: NWL and SOWPODS. Classic Words gameplay is classical to crosswords board games: create and place words on the board and boost your score by placing letters on the high-scoring Double Letter, Double Word, Triple Letter, and Triple Word squares. Use all 7 letters from your rack to play a Bingo and get a 50-point bonus. This game is a great time killer for all fans of board games and strategy games. It is also an educational game that will allow kids (and adults :-) ) to improve their spelling and vocabulary. Thanks to the fast reactivity of the artificial intelligence (AI) and to the official word lists, Classic Words can be used by traditional word game enthusiasts to play quick training matches and learn new words from the computer's moves. Unlike with multiplayer board games, where some dishonest players use anagram solvers, there is no cheating possible when playing in solitaire... Letters and blanks are always picked randomly, and the computer's artificial intelligence does not have more information than you do. Only your tactics and creativity can make the difference... Will you play strategically enough to outwit the computer and its extensive vocabulary? EXCLUSIVE FEATURES: - 6 levels of difficulty - Automatic display of the definition of the iPhone words - Distribution of letters and points are adapted to the language - Supports offline play Languages and dictionaries supported: - English (SOWPODS 2025 + NWL 2023) - French - German (with support of Umlauts, and Ezset to be replaced by two 'S') - Italian - Spanish - Dutch",

      "description": "In art, value (or tone) refers to how light or dark a colour is. If you're learning to paint or draw, doing value studies is one of the best ways to improve. These small, loose sketches in greyscale help you understand where shadows fall and highlights appear—essential for capturing depth and form. Value Study is a simple, focused tool designed to help you see values more clearly in your reference images. Instead of just converting a photo to black and white, this app lets you break down tones step by step. Start with just black and white to map out the biggest shapes, then gradually add more values to refine your understanding. You can also highlight all areas of an image that share the same value, making it easier to see subtle shifts in tone. This is especially useful in complex references, like portraits, where different parts of the image might have the same level of shadow but look completely different in colour. Value Study isn’t here to replace traditional studies—it’s here to enhance them. Whether you're sketching, painting, or working digitally, this tool makes it easier to focus on the fundamentals of light, shadow, and form. Try it for free with all features enabled on sample images from Unsplash before deciding to unlock the full app with a low-cost yearly or lifetime purchase. All Value Study Pro upgrades count as lifetime purchase. Either option will unlock Value Study across iPhone, iPad and Mac. Annual: Auto-renews yearly. Lifetime: One-time payment, no fees.

      "description": "Get your scofield Bible or scofield reference Bible for with King James Bible text. A student of the word needs to have references to other commentaries so they can learn the word of God well. As a Bible is it important to have a Bible commentary which gives you an understanding of certain scriptures. The Bible commentary is not supposed to replace our communion with the Holy Spirit. This is as a help but the Holy Spirit is our ultimate helper. Written originally in 1909, C. I. Scofield's intent was to provide a concise but complete tool that would meet the need of someone just beginning to read the Bible and it has helped a lot of people to understand the Bible very well. The Scofield Reference Bible contains very brief commentary, often consisting of no more than a few sentences and several cross-references. Usually the definitions are short which makes it easy to memorize. The good thing about this Scofield reference Bible is that it is completely offline and can be used when you are on the go. This is Bible in your pocket reference Bible. The Scofield Study Bible had several innovative features. Most important, it printed what amounted to a commentary on the biblical text alongside the Bible instead of in a separate volume. This Scofield Bible has embedded in it King James Bible which you can move in between screens easily whiles doing your reference Bible study. The King James Bible that comes with it has daily Bible verses which shows on your phone daily. It also has audio that you can download and listen to offline as you choose. Do you have a scripture in mind that you want to bookmark or save as a favorite? Then this can be done as well. Gone are the days when you have a King James Bible and then you have a highlighter that you use to highlight different words. This is also possible in this application. You have the option to choose several colors and to use them to make a remarkable Bible interface to save the best things God has taught you whiles reading the Bible. The Scofield reference Bible contains a cross-referencing system that tied together related verses of Scripture and allowed a reader to follow biblical themes from one chapter and book to another. It was in the pages of the Scofield Reference Bible that many Christians first encountered Archbishop James Ussher's calculation of the date of Creation as 4004 BC; and through discussion of Scofield's notes, which advocated the \"gap theory,\" fundamentalists began a serious internal debate about the nature and chronology of creation. There is so much good news in the word of God. God enjoys it when His children read His word and are obedient to it in all things. We give Him all the praise for all the things He has done. Get daily Bible verses In this scofield Bible reference you also get daily Bible verses for your daily motivation. The goodness of God will never cease and with our daily Bible reading, we are able to have the best of things we need. Bookmark feature of scofield reference Bible or scofield offline Bible Every verse you like can be bookmarked in the KJV Bible offline section for quick reference. Scofield reference is a must have Bible app for the Bible believing Christian. When referring to the reference it helps. There is audio Bible on the other side of this reference which helps those who cannot read so well to listen to the Bible in style.",

      "description": "Chord reference and chord finder for guitar, bass, banjo, ukulele, mandolin and bouzouki. Supports standard and alternate tunings and includes more than forty-five chord types: both simple and complicated ones used in jazz music, including slash chords. You can display, compare and practice several different chords at once. They may be the chords of a song or different variations of the same chord. You can adjust the complexity of the chord shapes shown according to your skill. In addition to the usual chord shapes, ChordAid lets you choose among more difficult chord shapes with two barres and big stretching between fingers. Several strumming options or finger-picking style are available. Supports left handed players. You can translate chords from one instrument to another. You can mark individual chord shapes as favorites. Then you can switch to a display mode that shows you favorite shapes only. In this way you can build a chord library of your own. In a \"Reverse Chord Finder\" mode, you can select a few notes on the fretboard and the app will show you the names of the chords that match. You can then add the chord to the chord list and the app will show other fingerings. Here is a list of the currently supported instruments and tunings: • Guitar 6 strings - Standard - Open C, D, G, A, B, E, C#, D minor, G minor - Modal D, G - Drop C, D, B - Tenor (Mandola) • Bass guitar 4 strings - Standard - Drop C, D • Bass guitar 5 strings - Standard - Tenor • Ukulele - Concert, Concert low G - D - Canadian - Baritone - Bass • Mandolin - Standard - Mandola • Bouzouki - Three, four courses - Irish - Octave mandolin - Open D, G • Guitalele • Banjo 5 strings - Open G, D, A - Drop C, Double C, Old time D, Sawmill • Banjo 4 strings - Standard(CGDA), Celtic, Chicago, Plectrum • Waldzither Please visit our support page if you have questions about using the application or if you have any issues.

      "description": "The Scofield Study Bible is a timeless favorite among study Bibles, especially for those interested in dispensational theology or tracing how God’s plan unfolds through the ages. First published in the early 1900s by C.I. Scofield has stood the test of time, becoming a go-to resource for pastors, teachers, and serious Bible students across generations. The Scofield Bible is great for those interested in Bible prophecy and how God’s plan unfolds through history. It’s especially helpful for KJV readers who want structured, theological commentary and for Bible students who appreciate a clear, systematic approach to Scripture.

      "description": "This app responds to clinicians’ questions about tuberculosis infection, disease, and control. The standards and guidelines are based on the work and experience of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), Emory University, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Atlanta TB Prevention Coalition. This edition contains updated recommendations on the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treatment of active tuberculosis disease. The treatment of a patient with TB always requires a clinician to exercise clinical and professional judgment. These guidelines provide a framework for the treatment of patients with TB infection or disease. Standardized treatment offers the greatest opportunity for controlling tuberculosis. This is not an exhaustive treatment of the subjects covered. It is an accessible reference guide. Since guidelines for treating and controlling TB continue to evolve, it is appropriate for clinicians to check further for new treatment regimens. Last edit to the content was June 2022. Disclaimer: please remember to seek a doctor's advice in addition to using this app before making any medical decisions.",

      "description": "This app is a fully functional transformer lab simulator that was designed and developed by a journeyman lineman, for lineman and apprentices. You can use this app to study and learn your transformer connections. When the fuses are closed in you can test your connections with a volt meter, ohm meter, and a rotation meter. Abnormal voltages and cutout fuses exploding can occur when improper connections are made. In the labs you can also inspect the transformers' nameplates and secondary coils. Quick reference diagrams, basic transformer informational reading material and more are available in this application. The Quiz mode lets you test your knowledge. The Company Customized Experience is a way for your Power Company to work with us where we will modify the app to match their spec. Tell them to reach out to us if they are interested! Current Labs in this app: -Single Phase- Single Bushing Topside Dual Bushing Topside -Three Phase- Delta Delta Closed Delta Wye Closed Wye Delta Closed Wye Wye Closed Delta Delta Open Wye Delta Open -Misc- Paralleling 4th Cutout Troubleshooting Tutorial -Advanced- Straight 480 240/480 277/480 Corner Grounded 240 or 480 Wye Wye 5 Wire (120/240 & 120/208) -Quiz- Test your transformer wiring knowledge by completing a predetermined assortment of labs at random. Blowing fuses and attempting to Check Work subtract from your overall score out of 100. -Advanced Quiz- Test your overall transformer knowledge by completing a series of random quizzes where you receive basic job-site information and have to choose the correct transformer nameplate and secondary coil configuration. You will then have the option to wire up the corresponding bank.",

      "description": "The Scofield Reference Bible Commentary is a widely circulated study Bible edited and annotated by the American Bible student Cyrus I. Scofield, which popularized dispensationalism at the beginning of the 20th century. Published by Oxford University Press and containing the entire text of the traditional, Protestant King James Version, it first appeared in 1909 and was revised by the author in 1917 The Scofield Reference Bible had several innovative features. Most important, it printed what amounted to a commentary on the biblical text alongside the Bible instead of in a separate volume, the first to do so since the Geneva Bible (1560). It also contained a cross-referencing system that tied together related verses of Scripture and allowed a reader to follow biblical themes from one chapter and book to another (so called \"chain references\"). Finally, the 1917 edition also attempted to date events of the Bible. It was in the pages of the Scofield Reference Bible that many Christians first encountered Archbishop James Ussher's calculation of the date of Creation as 4004 BC; and through discussion of Scofield's notes, which advocated the \"gap theory,\" fundamentalists began a serious internal debate about the nature and chronology of creation. The Scofield Bible was published only a few years before World War I, a war that destroyed the cultural optimism that had viewed the world as entering a new era of peace and prosperity; then the post-World War II era witnessed the creation in Israel of a homeland for the Jews. Thus, Scofield's premillennialism seemed prophetic. \"At the popular level, especially, many people came to regard the dispensationalist scheme as completely vindicated.\" Sales of the Reference Bible exceeded two million copies by the end of World War II. The Scofield Reference Bible promoted dispensationalism, the belief that between creation and the final judgment there would be seven distinct eras of God's dealing with man and that these eras are a framework for synthesizing the message of the Bible. It was largely through the influence of Scofield's notes that dispensationalism grew in influence among fundamentalist Christians in the United States. Scofield's notes on the Book of Revelation are a major source for the various timetables, judgments, and plagues elaborated on by popular religious writers such as Hal Lindsey, Edgar C. Whisenant, and Tim LaHaye; and in part because of the success of the Scofield Reference Bible, twentieth-century American fundamentalists placed greater stress on eschatological speculation. Opponents of biblical fundamentalism have criticized the Scofield Bible for its air of total authority in biblical interpretation, for what they consider its glossing over of biblical contradictions, and for its focus on eschatology. The 1917 Scofield Reference Bible notes are now in the public domain, and the Bible is \"consistently the best selling edition of the Scofield Bible\" in the United Kingdom and Ireland.In 1967, Oxford University Press published a revision of the Scofield Bible with a slightly modernized KJV text, and a muting of some of the tenets of Scofield's theology. Recent editions of the KJV Scofield Study Bible have moved the textual changes made in 1967 to the margin.

Traditional educational tools flood learners with the infamous \"fire hose\" of information with little direction for which information is most critical for the boards and the wards. Students instead cram for exams and rely on question banks and seemingly endless \"pimping\" sessions in the hospital to begin building a mental framework. These methods are effective but represent a reactive learning strategy with clear room for improvement. With this in mind, a team of medical students at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences worked with the Microbiology and IT departments to create μBio, a medical microbiology reference application built specifically for medical students. App Highlights Content: Key testable information related to medically-relevant bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Content is continually re-evaluated and updated for accuracy, utility, and simplicity. Access: Data is stored on your device for instant, offline access (important in the hospital setting with limited connectivity). Data updates and external resources are available on demand when connected to the web. Build Foundation: Content is intentionally light-weight and consists of only the most relevant information. This is meant to lower the barrier for material review and encourage repetition throughout the day, rather than cramming before the exam. Expand Knowledge: Key facts link to additional detail (diagrams, articles, etc.) while connected to the internet to allow for deeper learning in academic settings. Search by Anything: When you come across a bug in the classroom or the hospital, instantly access high-yield information by typing all or part of the the name, transmission, morphology, treatment, any more. Feedback: We are constantly looking to improve both the functionality of the app and the quality of the data. Use the bug-specific feedback (bug-specific pages, top-right menu) for specific content feedback as well as the general feedback form (main page, top-right menu) for general feedback.
