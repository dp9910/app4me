      "description": "Flora is a new way to stay off your phone, clear to-do lists, and build positive, life-changing habits. Whenever you want to make progress towards your goals, plant a seed in Flora. As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be. FOCUS TREES Have trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees. DOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS Things get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.* * Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. TO-DO LIST & WIDGET Flora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it. HABIT TRACKER Enjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills. REAL TREES, REAL IMPACT Why not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org and Eden Reforestation Projects, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most. Sounds good? Download Flora and join our 2,000,000+ productive users now!",

Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial. ## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. ## Over 1,500,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users. \"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider If you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. The sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done. Stay focused, Be present! STAY FOCUSED • A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction • Turn your focused moments into a lush forest. • Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked. (iOS 16 or above) GET MOTIVATED • Earn rewards and unlock more than 90 new tree species and white noises. • Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world. • Plant trees along with friends & family. • Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards. • Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future. STATISTICS • Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution. • Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest. • Track your focused time in the Apple Health App. • Track your daily phone usage and screen time. • Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline! It's never too late to build up productive habits! NOTICE • Forest is compatible with iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and can be used across these iOS devices with a one-time purchase. The full app with the aforementioned features is available on iPhone and iPad; on Apple Watch you can view live planting session and today’s focus stats. To download or unlock a non-iOS version, it requires a separate purchase. By logging into the same account, your data can be synchronized across all platforms. • Due to iOS limitations, the Allow List feature is only available on iOS/iPadOS 16 or above. If you’re using a device running iOS/iPadOS 15 or below, your tree will wither when you leave Forest during a planting session. • Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates. • There is only one version of Forest on the App Store.

Get reminded about a note at the right time or place. • Record a voice memo and have it automatically transcribed. • Grab the text from an image to help you quickly find that note again through search. WHEN AND WHERE YOU NEED IT Need to remember to pick up some groceries? Set a location-based reminder to pull up your grocery list right when you get to the store. Need to finish a to-do? Set a time-based reminder to make sure you never miss a thing. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS Next time you go to the store, share your shopping list on Keep and watch as items get checked off in real time. No need for text messages back and forth.

      "description": "Companies in every industry around the world grow their business in Slack because it gets busywork off their plates and wasteful meetings off their calendars. Slack brings everyone from coworkers, customers, and contractors into one secure place, so you don’t have to chase approvals or wait around on emails. Slack even has AI that can search to find the information you need instantly and summarize conversations to catch you up with a click. Better yet, Slack makes it easy for anyone on your team to automate the small stuff, giving everyone more time to focus on the big picture. AKA, growing your business. COLLABORATE QUICKER. Work alongside teammates and external partners securely in Slack. • Connect with everyone: Invite vendors, customers, and contractors to work with you and your coworkers — all in one place. • Video chat face-to-face, from anywhere: Meet with teammates instantly through video conferencing, and discuss work live with screen sharing. • Crystal-clear communication: Use voice notes when text alone doesn’t cut it, ensuring complicated messages are better understood. • Stay organized: Keep project, customer, and product conversations in dedicated channels and documents. ACCESS YOUR KNOWLEDGE. Slack is where you can find every file, message, and decision. • Find anything, instantly: Our intelligent, AI-powered search understands context and saves you from digging around to find the answers you need to do your job.** • Collaborate on deliverables: Co-create marketing plans, product specs, and more in shared documents that live right next to your team’s conversations. • Streamline project execution: Track tasks, owners, and priorities with project management tools and lists that connect seamlessly to the rest of your work.* • Create consistent processes: Make sure every new project is set up to succeed with Slack-generated or custom-created* templates. • Capture meeting notes automatically: Let AI transcribe and summarize meeting notes for you in Slack, so you can focus on the conversation.** PERFECT EVERY PROCESS. Let Slack automations do your busywork for you. • Centralize your work: Connect to 2,600+ apps and focus just on Slack, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Asana, Zapier, Figma, Zendesk, and more. • Manage routine tasks: Approve PTO requests, manage your calendar, or update file permissions — all in one place (talk about convenient). • Stay on top of your to-dos: Manage your to-do list from your notepad to where you’re getting the rest of your work done. • Bring the power of Agentforce to your team: Access AI agents to respond to HR tickets, set team reminders, resolve IT issues, and much more.*** *Requires an upgrade to Slack Pro, Business+, or Enterprise. **Requires Slack AI add-on ***Requires Agentforce license from Salesforce",

Have you tried a digital detox? And it did not work, because you fall back into your habits immediately? Well here is the solution: one sec solves our unhealthy phone relationship at its roots: by making distracting apps less appealing, our brains lose interest to open them all the time without proper intention. The effectiveness of one sec has been confirmed in a peer-reviewed scientific study with the Max-Planck Institute and Heidelberg University: app usage drops by 57% on average! Long-term! Fight the social media algorithms and win back control over your phone usage & your subconsciousness! “one sec” uses Shortcuts Automation to toggle a deep breath animation whenever you open one of the configured apps (Instagram, Twitter, YouTube…). This breaks unconcious social media habits short-term (literally, as soon as you have set it up) and even helps long-term by adding more friction when opening these apps. Did you really want to open Instagram? Or was it just because you're bored waiting for your bus? This app helps you to reflect your actions, thoughts, and feelings; disrupting harmful social media habits with mindfulness. On top of that, “one sec” also contributes your mindful moments to the Health App via HealthKit. Especially for people with ADHD one sec is a great tool to gain back control for incredible focus and concentration. Integrations and collabs: - You can set up one sec to sync tasks with Structured, so you won't be able to access social media apps during ongoing unfinished tasks. - You can set up one sec to learn a new language with LENGO, so every time you open social media, you have to answer a handful of vocabularies.

In addition to the announcements of our BIG 5.0 update, we’re taking the time today to polish the update and address some bugs: - Fixes an issue where the intention picker would not show up. - Sheet automatically resizes to full-screen when selecting a custom block duration. - Overlapping blocks are now sorted correctly. - Advanced breathing exercises (such as box breathing or 4-7-8) now use Liquid Glass for the dismiss button as well. - Slightly refined settings UI – and moved iCloud Backup settings under the account tab. - Fix where the toggle to turn off 50% budget remaining notifications did not work. - Ensures that our FAQs are shown when pressing the FAQ button on the tips tab. - Fixes an issue where the phone-free morning / Awake integration wouldn’t display the selected set of apps and categories. - Changes the icon for the phone-free morning to a more friendly one. - Fixes multiple background crashes (hopefully). - Fixes an issue where the toggle to enable a weekday-based intervention schedule wouldn't work. - Automatically expands the new block sheet to full size while selecting a custom time interval. - Adds a new toggle in “Don’t get lost notifications” to show a warning notification when reaching a 50% threshold of a Re-Intervention or delayed intervention. - Applies new Liquid Glass design to “U sure bout that?” intervention. Don’t forget: if you like one sec, please write us a nice review on the App Store. This helps to spread the word about the app. Thanks a lot for your ongoing support, have a great day! – Frederik",

Our application blends modern technologies with the philosophy of Kaizen (改善) – a Japanese concept symbolizing \"continuous improvement.\" Productivity is a skill that our \"inner monkey\" (the mechanism of primal reactions that can distract you from goals and tasks for instant gratification) doesn't particularly favor. While fully taming this monkey might be an ambitious task, Kaizen helps you become more productive and efficient. Penetrating into every aspect of your life, Kaizen offers the following modes: 1. Main Task List: Create, edit, and manage tasks – whether they're work-related or personal. This list is always accessible, aiding in organizing everything that demands your attention. 2. Morning List: Focus on your morning ritual. Create and save your habits, selecting actions you want to repeat daily. Kaizen will remind you of them, helping you start the day energetically and enhance productivity. 3. Anti-List: Highlight actions that drain your energy. Create a list and use it to concentrate on vital tasks, sidestepping distractions. These application modes will help boost productivity, structure your day, and concentrate on what truly matters. Regardless of your goals, Kaizen – your dependable partner – accompanies you on the path to improvement and efficiency.",

      "description": "Productivity Challenge Timer aims to help you be more productive, more focused, waste less time and so on, you already know all that stuff. What this app is really about is challenging you to work harder and tracking your work habits. You'll earn/lose ranks depending on your performance, earn achievements and track your productivity over time, so you'll know how long you worked on what and during which days of the week and hours of the day you're at your most productive. Now here's a few things you should know before downloading: - This is not an organizer. If you can't keep track of what you're supposed to be doing, this is not the app for you. The app includes tracking of projects so you know how much time you spent working on each of your clients/books/websites/whatever - like a time sheet, but it's not meant to be an organizer or a to-do list. - This app will not let you pause work sessions or finish them early, so if you have a tiny baby-sized bladder and you need to pause every few minutes, this is not the app for you. The shortest work session you can set is 10 minutes and you're not supposed to be interrupted. Besides, I use this app too, and I'd be the first to abuse that pause feature to go look up useless nonsense instead of getting work done. - The purpose of this app is not to promote a healthy work-life balance, but to get you to work harder. Because of this, it does not recognize weekends or holidays or parenting or any other excuse people come up with to take time off, and it will demote you if you start slipping. Please don't expect the app to validate your personal goals, its sole purpose is to make you work harder, even when you shouldn't. That's it, thanks for reading and I hope you find this app as useful as I do.",

      "description": "This is the original To-Do and Task Management List and one of the most popular, powerful, and award-winning to-do list and task manager iOS and iPad apps ever! Todo has been used by millions of individuals, families and teams for GETTING THINGS DONE. \"Todo has stood the test of time\" -Silicon Slopes. Winner of the “Best Productivity App for iPad” (Best Apps Ever, To-Do Apps) and listed among the “Top Ten Paid Productivity Apps...\" \"Appigo Todo oozes with awesomeness. I’ve tried numerous iOS task-management apps, and none to date have satisfied me as much as Todo.” –Macworld, 4.5 stars. Four main reasons to consider Todo: 1. REAL PRODUCTIVITY. Unlike lightweight, freebie or cutesy list tools, Todo 10 is useful when you have a deadline, NEED to focus, prioritize and get things done quickly--from home or school projects to dozens of detailed work tasks. Includes: Projects, Sub-tasks, Start Dates, Due Dates, Recurring Tasks (with detailed recurring options), Multiple Task Alerts, Overdue Tasks, Drag and Drop, Search, Print Lists, Folders, and much more. 2. PROVEN GTD METHODOLOGY. Todo uses the popular Getting Things Done approach with Focus To-do Lists, Starred Tasks, Multi-level Priorities, Quick Entry, Context, and Projects with Layered and Prioritized Sub-Tasks—all recommended GTD approaches. 3. BUILT-IN SYNCING. Sync automatically in the background with Todo Cloud Sync. Keep everything in sync, access your data from any device and never be locked into a specific service—your data remains yours. 4. COOLNESS • Add, schedule, and organize your to-dos • Set due dates and reminders to never miss an important date or deadline • Quickly add tasks using Siri, Email or Todo Cloud’s Quick Add buttons • Streamline projects, checklists and tasks using customized Siri commands. • Customize task reminders based on day (January 1), time (2:00pm) and place (when you are near the grocery store) • Create themed lists to organize your to-dos: home, work, friends, etc. • Take control of how you view and execute your to-dos with Todo Smart Lists • Collaborate with friends, family and/or team members using Shared Lists • Leave yourself (or others) updates through in-task notes and comments • Create recurring tasks for those to-dos that come over and over again • Sync your to-dos across all your devices 14 day FREE trial! Todo Cloud is one of the most affordable individual or team task management solutions. Others cost $10- $50 more per year, and some even require you to pay extra for every platform. Not Todo Cloud. The Todo subscription will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel the subscription renewal at any time, and the subscription you purchased will remain active until the end of the current period.

      "description": "DayNinja combines the best productivity methods in the world: Pomodoro technique ™ by Francesco Cirillo, GTD by David Allen, Deep work, timeboxing and more all in one FREE app. Backed by scientifically proven time management methods this free pomodoro focus timer app will help you to be more productive. Some features include: - Day View: Integrates with your calendar. See your focus tasks planned out between appointments. - New Day: DayNinja cleans up old tasks and resets your timers ready for you to re-prioritise focus goals each day. - KPI Performance streaks: Measure your focus each day and compare with daily performance charts. - Metrics: Learn how many hours you spend doing focused work, breaks and the time you will finish your workday based on your goals and appointments. - To-do: prioritise your days’ tasks by drag & drop. - Target block count & estimates: keep motivated with focus goals, set your personal daily targets. - Optimised user interface: Quick swipe actions to keep you in flow throughout your day. - Customise your block & break durations as you grow your ability to focus. - Tags let you see at a glance related tasks and projects in your todo list. - Satisfying sounds keep your day light and a smile on your face as you slash through tasks. - Flow state friendly: keep working when you get in the zone and your focus time is still tracked. - Focus time summary: receive a report of your total focus time each week. The ideal productivity tool for founders, professional freelancers, designers and coders. --- From the author: \"Do you know how many hours of your day are actually productive, focused time? Whether it be phone calls, emails, your smartphone or well-meaning colleagues tapping you on the shoulder for a “Do you have a minute?” kind of chat, our days are bombarded with interruptions. Before we know it, the day is over and we are left feeling rather down and thinking \"Eek!? ...Is that all I got done today?\" Now let’s just assume that it is possible to work in a quiet place away from external interruptions. Our own minds are an even bigger source of distraction, with a new thought entering our minds every 3 minutes! Unless we have a system, a method, a process - whatever you want to call it, the outcome is likely to be the same day after day: stressful mess bouncing between other people’s agendas and not getting your most important work done. Sound familiar? This app has been inspired by proven productivity techniques: Pomodoro timer: The idea is to work in predetermined blocks of time. To do this, simply break a task up into 25-minute segments without stopping or getting distracted. Getting Things Done®: Begin with a to-do list for the day and classify tasks according to priority. --- You have allocated tasks, time, all under your own terms, you have achieved your goals, performed every task with a sense of quality and you finish every day satisfied. It sounds simple, and it is… in concept, but don’t expect to master this technique right away. It takes weeks of practicing the method day in and day out. It takes discipline. I have strayed at times when overwhelmed, I have reached the end of the week and wondered, “Where did I achieve this week”. It is those weeks when I have failed to be disciplined and failed to use the app. I have let other people’s agendas overrun my own. Researchers have proven that self-control is one of the key determinants of success. When you exercise self-control and self-discipline through a good part of your day, it cannot help but spill over into other areas of your life... How you eat, sleep and your health and happiness. Stick with it, and you too will be a DayNinja. Nathan Challen theDayNinja.com Want to learn more? read: “Zen and the art of getting Sh*t done” & Medium or subscribe for more productivity tips. Psst!
