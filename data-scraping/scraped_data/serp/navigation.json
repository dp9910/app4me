      "description": "Ever have a stressful day navigating on the water? Wanted to know more about the conditions you are about to head into? Are you looking for exciting places to explore, the best place to refuel, or just trying to meet up with a friend? Wavve Boating takes a new spin on traditional boating navigation by bringing detailed nautical charts, tide predictions, weather forecasts, and more in one easy-to-use tool. Join a fast-growing community of boaters building a network of marine knowledge that everyone can enjoy. With Wavve Boating you get: - Simple and Seamless Marine GPS Navigation - Put away overcrowded and complex charts and apps. Wavve Boating's GPS focuses on important and relevant information so that navigating is as easy as staying in the blue and avoiding the red. - Custom Nautical Charts - View and change Wavve Boating's nautical charts based on your unique boating needs and preferences. Set your draft and Wavve Boating redraws the nautical charts to fit your boat. Nautical charts are available for the USA, Canada, Australia and the UK. You can view a map of our coverage on our website. - Community Boating - Just like at the dock or on the water, we all help each other in Wavve Boating. Share expert knowledge of the local waterways by adding shared points of interest to the map. The community can vote on pins, making sure they are all valid and valuable. Not quite ready to share a great find? No problem, you can keep your points of interest private as well. - Tides - Track changes in water height in tidal regions and along rivers and lakes with the tides function. View a body of water in North America, and the app will update to reflect the current water levels. View predicted water heights up to 18 hours in advance and track the next tidal variances. - Weather - Check the weather, including a complete seven-day forecast, across all of North America. Easily view the temperature, wind speed, and wave height as you move around the map. The local daily forecasts are color-coded to show if it is dangerous to go boating, using guidelines from the Coast Guard's small vessel advisory. - Fleets of Friends - See who is on the water and where they are by adding friends to your fleet. Share your locations with members of your fleet to make meeting up a breeze. Want to keep your best fishing hole a secret, even from your boating buds? Easily hide your location to boat under the radar. - So Long Chart Plotters - Marine navigation is more than concentrating on a cluttered chart plotter. Get your head out of the cabin and enjoy the journey. Stop buying marine charts piece by piece for your chart plotter. Wavve Boating has integrated all the marine charts into one map for your boating GPS needs. Subscription Pricing and Terms Wavve Boating is free to download, and all customers are welcome to a free 14 day trial period. Should you choose to continue to use the Wavve Boating app after the free trial, we offer two auto-renewing subscription options, monthly ($11.99/month) or yearly ($59.99/year). Wavve Boating needs you! We've built the platform, but it is boaters that will build our Wavver community. Share your knowledge, share your time, and save a prop or two in the process.

Yandex Maps provides information about organizations and helps you reach your destination by car, public transport, bike, or on foot based on current traffic conditions. Search for and select locations: • The largest organization database and filters to refine your search. • Detailed information: contacts, hours of operation, services provided, photos, and reviews. • Floor plans to find your way around Moscow's major shopping malls. • Search for places and addresses without an internet connection (offline maps). • View places saved on your smartphone, tablet, and PC. Custom map settings: • Real-time location of buses, trams, trolleybuses, and minibuses. • Road maps that show current traffic conditions in the city. • Parking layer with the location and cost of official parking. • Street panoramas for a road-side view of any address. • Choose from three map types: Roadmap, Satellite, and Hybrid. Public transport, car, bike, and walking routes: • Pedestrian navigation: paths between buildings, through parks, across squares, and other pedestrian zones. • Bike navigation: road types, underpass and overpass preferences, and highway warnings. • Public transport routes with timetables and estimated time of arrival. • Optimal driving routes based on live traffic conditions and driving options. • Step-by-step instructions with voice navigation. • Speed camera, speed limit, and speeding notifications. • Real-time updates on traffic, road accidents, speed radar, and more. Offline maps: • Driving routes and voice navigation. • Downloadable lightweight maps (minimum storage space, for example, the Moscow map is just 187 MB). • Database of organizations with hours of operation, services provided, and more. • Over 2000 cities in Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Estonia. Information from users: • Mark road events on the map and comment on user submissions. • Regular updates to the Public Map keep you informed about your city. • Write reviews, upload photos, and update information about organizations. Yandex Maps has an Apple Watch app. Use it to: • Navigate the map. • View the nearest metro station and public transport stops. • Find out when public transport will arrive at a nearby stop. • Track traffic patterns a few hours ahead of time. • View weather forecasts.

      "description": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad. Key Features: • High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections. • Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes. • Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button. • Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency. • Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course. • No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button. • Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history. • Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.

      "description": "TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE - Plan, ride, track and share your adventures with the #1 rated motorbike navigation app. 200,000 public routes, 20 million hours ridden, 130 million miles logged. GET THERE YOUR WAY - We’ve built a world for motorcyclists, helping you find the best routes with the twistiest turns, for paved touring and unpaved adventures. It’s not the destination that counts. It’s the journey. FIND THE ROAD - Straight, curvy, paved, dirty - Scenic lets you control your route like no other app. And with thousands of public routes to choose from, there's always road to ride. TAKE CONTROL - Plan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy. UNLOCK EPIC RIDES - Scenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search', and see what comes up. GO EXPLORING - Yet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing. GET ORGANISED - Found a great route online? Have some lying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB, or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure. FIND FOCUS - On-screen instructions, turn-by-turn navigation, and customizable detour behavior mean you can focus on the road, not your phone. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves, or one of the supported handlebar controllers. CHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Customize your map, toggling between built-in layers like traffic flow, safety camera alerts, and 3D buildings, as well as a huge list of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle services, restaurants, hotels, and more! ONE STEP AHEAD - Dirt road visualization, elevation profiles, speed camera warnings, and traffic visualized on the map keep you prepared for what’s around the corner. GO OFF GRID - No data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back. KNOW YOUR RIDE - Scenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed, and elevation - helping you relive every moment, track your progress, and challenge your friends. SHARE THE ADVENTURE - Leave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalized web page of your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media. CHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Personalize your map, seamlessly switching between visual layers like traffic flow and street view. Choose your own color codes to quickly identify and distinguish routes and a wide range of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle service points, restaurants, hotels, and much more. * Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. ** Scenic has an optional yearly Premium Subscription with a free trial period, that gives you access to Premium Features (see scenic.app/premium for details). The subscription automatically renews after the free trial period, and then every year. The first payment will be charged to your App Store Account at the end of your trial period. It automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of each period. Subscriptions may be managed by you, and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings in the Apple App Store.

        "description": "TAKE THE SCENIC ROUTE - Plan, ride, track and share your adventures with the #1 rated motorbike navigation app. 200,000 public routes, 20 million hours ridden, 130 million miles logged. GET THERE YOUR WAY - We’ve built a world for motorcyclists, helping you find the best routes with the twistiest turns, for paved touring and unpaved adventures. It’s not the destination that counts. It’s the journey. FIND THE ROAD - Straight, curvy, paved, dirty - Scenic lets you control your route like no other app. And with thousands of public routes to choose from, there's always road to ride. TAKE CONTROL - Plan routes by dropping via points and stops. Scenic will show you a route between them. Don't like it? Choose another routing mode, including curvy. UNLOCK EPIC RIDES - Scenic has a vast database of thousands of beautiful routes, shared and rated by local Scenic users worldwide. Select an area, tap 'Search', and see what comes up. GO EXPLORING - Yet another way to get a great route... set the distance, then let Scenic generate a round trip for you in any given direction. Or a curvy route to a destination of your choosing. GET ORGANISED - Found a great route online? Have some lying around in Basecamp? Whether it’s a Google Maps URL or a GPX, KML, KMZ, GDB, or ITN file, import it into Scenic to keep all your routes in one app that’s built for adventure. FIND FOCUS - On-screen instructions, turn-by-turn navigation, and customizable detour behavior mean you can focus on the road, not your phone. When you do need to tap in, Scenic is designed to work seamlessly with your touch-enabled gloves, or one of the supported handlebar controllers. CHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Customize your map, toggling between built-in layers like traffic flow, safety camera alerts, and 3D buildings, as well as a huge list of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle services, restaurants, hotels, and more! ONE STEP AHEAD - Dirt road visualization, elevation profiles, speed camera warnings, and traffic visualized on the map keep you prepared for what’s around the corner. GO OFF GRID - No data/reception? No problem. Scenic’s offline maps mean you can go where others turn back. KNOW YOUR RIDE - Scenic not only navigates you, it also logs your location, speed, and elevation - helping you relive every moment, track your progress, and challenge your friends. SHARE THE ADVENTURE - Leave pictures and comments for other riders in the app, get a personalized web page of your routes and rides, or share your journey straight to social media. CHOOSE YOUR VIEW - Personalize your map, seamlessly switching between visual layers like traffic flow and street view. Choose your own color codes to quickly identify and distinguish routes and a wide range of POIs, including fuel and EV charging stations, motorcycle service points, restaurants, hotels, and much more. * Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. ** Scenic has an optional yearly Premium Subscription with a free trial period, that gives you access to Premium Features (see scenic.app/premium for details). The subscription automatically renews after the free trial period, and then every year. The first payment will be charged to your App Store Account at the end of your trial period. It automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of each period. Subscriptions may be managed by you, and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings in the Apple App Store.

All currently valid editions of the NV Verlag / NV Charts nautical charts or inland charts | North Sea | Baltic Sea | Netherlands | Wadden Sea | Ijsselmeer | Sweden | Denmark | Germany | Norway | France | USA | Caribbean | Bahamas areas are compatible with the NV Charts App. Enjoy the best of both worlds - paper and digital: A perfect match is our popular combination package of high-quality digital charts and cleverly designed paper charts. Alternatively, you can also purchase digital nautical charts directly via the app with a convenient annual subscription that renews automatically. The integrated update service keeps the charts up to date. If it is not yet clear where the journey should go or no offline charts are activated, free online charts can be displayed for all NV Charts chart areas, even without a currently valid chart licence.

You can mark harbours, anchorages and navigation warnings on the digital nautical chart and also add pictures of interesting places that go beyond navigation, such as restaurants or popular attractions, and share them with the community. Others can respond directly with comments. The continuously edited content can be downloaded directly to be available offline. To make all the information easily accessible, the app offers a search function. You can explore the surroundings and search directly for place names as well as anchorages, harbours, ramps, waypoints, cranes, fuel stations or tide stations. The app also offers fast and flexible auto-routing, allowing you to navigate directly to your destination and edit a route manually. Navigation on board is even more fun together! You can share your tracks with friends or use the data outside the app and export it as a GPX file. You can easily share your favourite harbours and anchorages from the app via a link and coordinate your trip planning even better with everyone. The AIS function in the NV Charts App allows you to keep an eye on AIS signals in real time. A WiFi AIS receiver can be connected to the NV Charts App for this purpose. The AIS Class A and B targets and aids to navigation (ATON), as well as MOB AIS SART transponder emergency transmitters, are displayed, and the traffic situation can be better assessed.

SeaNav uses Digital Vector charts providing a wealth of benefits and advantages. Buoys, Lights, Bridges, Depth Contours, Depth Soundings, Rocks, Anchorage areas, NOAA Weather Buoys etc. are all selectable and have real time distance, bearing and detail information. Turn off layers to de-clutter the display and only show what is important at the time. Tides, moon and sun times and weather are also all available at your fingertips. SeaNav’s unique AR view mode allows you to view buoys, lights, ships, waypoints and track overlaid on your iPhone or iPad live camera view. With \"AR LockOn\" you can select a target on the chart and then be guided to it in the AR camera view. SeaNav lets you measure distances and bearings and record waypoints on routes. When at sea, the app’s Sailing HUD shows your position, Course over ground (COG), Speed over ground (SOG), Vector Made Good (VMG), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), Distance and bearing to next Waypoint. Waypoint reached alerts, auto-routing to the next waypoint and collision alerts. SeaNav has free Apple Watch and Pebble Smartwatch apps available. Lowrance, Simrad and B&G GoFree support included.

      "description": "Celestial navigation has never been easier! With ezAlmanacOne and a sextant you will be finding your fix like a pro in no time! ezAlmanacOne is an evolution of the iPad version of ezAlmanac with the modern user interface used in the Windows 10 version of ezAlmanac. All of the features of ezAlmanac plus new features including: - Universal app runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and the new MacBook with M1 processor. - Supports all device orientations. All screens support zoom and pan. - Make bearing observations to perform compass checks. - Archive saved observations and restore observation data from an archive. - Includes quick start guide, usage examples, and other documentation to learn celestial navigation. - Print/Output Nautical Almanac pages, observation reports, and other app documentation. ezAlmanacOne will help you perform celestial navigation exactly as it has been done for hundreds of years. It produces all Nautical Almanac (1960-2059) and Pub. 229 tables exactly as you are used to seeing them in the printed form. All tables can be accessed directly for manual usage if you choose to do so. Since they are produced by the software they support zooming and panning, and you can highlight in the tables to easily find the correct value to use. Most users, however, will prefer to let ezAlmanacOne do all of the work. Simply enter the basic sight parameters, make and enter your observations, and ezAlmanacOne will do the rest. It performs all of the steps to correct your observation, find GP of the object, do the sight reduction, and plot the LOP. No steps are skipped and all details are shown. Click where the LOPs cross in the plot and you have found your fix! Besides finding your fix, ezAlmanacOne is one of the best tools available to perform compass checks from a bearing observation of one of the navigational bodies. The compass check function supports checking up to 5 devices from a single bearing observation. ezAlmanacOne will also create a report of your compass check that can be saved as a PDF file or printed for the ships records. Celestial navigation instructors love ezAlmanacOne because it does celestial navigation exactly as they teach it. Values obtained from the Nautical Almanac and Pub. 229 are clearly identified with an icon of the book. When you press the book icon you are taken to the page that has that value with the row, column and value highlighted. Even when ezAlmanacOne is doing all the work, it can teach you how to do it manually using the books. For manual celestial navigation you can generate and print Nautical Almanac pages to use as a backup on a passage. You can even print the sight reduction forms and plotting sheets you will need. ezAlmanacOne performs all astronomical calculations using the NOVAS 3.1 software from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and a JPL ephemeris that covers the years 1960 through 2059. It also implements WMM-2020, the latest World Magnetic Model software available from NOAA, to compute magnetic declination. Since all calculations are performed in the software, ezAlmanacOne is fully functional with no dependency on the internet.",

        "description": "Celestial navigation has never been easier! With ezAlmanacOne and a sextant you will be finding your fix like a pro in no time! ezAlmanacOne is an evolution of the iPad version of ezAlmanac with the modern user interface used in the Windows 10 version of ezAlmanac. All of the features of ezAlmanac plus new features including: - Universal app runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and the new MacBook with M1 processor. - Supports all device orientations. All screens support zoom and pan. - Make bearing observations to perform compass checks. - Archive saved observations and restore observation data from an archive. - Includes quick start guide, usage examples, and other documentation to learn celestial navigation. - Print/Output Nautical Almanac pages, observation reports, and other app documentation. ezAlmanacOne will help you perform celestial navigation exactly as it has been done for hundreds of years. It produces all Nautical Almanac (1960-2059) and Pub. 229 tables exactly as you are used to seeing them in the printed form. All tables can be accessed directly for manual usage if you choose to do so. Since they are produced by the software they support zooming and panning, and you can highlight in the tables to easily find the correct value to use. Most users, however, will prefer to let ezAlmanacOne do all of the work. Simply enter the basic sight parameters, make and enter your observations, and ezAlmanacOne will do the rest. It performs all of the steps to correct your observation, find GP of the object, do the sight reduction, and plot the LOP. No steps are skipped and all details are shown. Click where the LOPs cross in the plot and you have found your fix! Besides finding your fix, ezAlmanacOne is one of the best tools available to perform compass checks from a bearing observation of one of the navigational bodies. The compass check function supports checking up to 5 devices from a single bearing observation. ezAlmanacOne will also create a report of your compass check that can be saved as a PDF file or printed for the ships records. Celestial navigation instructors love ezAlmanacOne because it does celestial navigation exactly as they teach it. Values obtained from the Nautical Almanac and Pub. 229 are clearly identified with an icon of the book. When you press the book icon you are taken to the page that has that value with the row, column and value highlighted. Even when ezAlmanacOne is doing all the work, it can teach you how to do it manually using the books. For manual celestial navigation you can generate and print Nautical Almanac pages to use as a backup on a passage. You can even print the sight reduction forms and plotting sheets you will need. ezAlmanacOne performs all astronomical calculations using the NOVAS 3.1 software from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and a JPL ephemeris that covers the years 1960 through 2059. It also implements WMM-2020, the latest World Magnetic Model software available from NOAA, to compute magnetic declination. Since all calculations are performed in the software, ezAlmanacOne is fully functional with no dependency on the internet.",

Unlock the full potential of TZ MAPS with a 7-day free trial. - AIS ONLINE: access AIS targets beyond your local receiver’s range by connecting to our global AIS network via the Internet. When enabled, any AIS targets within your local receiver’s range will automatically be shared with the community. Note: This feature requires the AIS module, which must be purchased to enable AIS Online. - COMMUNITY MAPS: contribute to the marine chart data in your navigation area by commenting, note-taking, voting, and modifying or deleting objects such as buoys, obstructions, and points of interest (restaurants and supply stores) in a participative way that benefits the whole TIMEZERO community, developing the most reliable and precise boat map. - DYNAMIC MOORINGS: discover classified nearby anchorages based on weather forecasts and topography. Dynamic color coding (Red, Orange, Green) provides wind direction for optimized anchorage comfort. - DYNAMIC LIGHTS: visualize light sectors according to your boat’s position and field of vision. Navigation lights on the map can flash in accordance with your position. Highlighted and flashing lights represent only those within your actual field of vision. - SMART SEARCH: access a high-performance search engine to find any information on our marine charts (tide stations, rocks, buoys, etc.) as well as in your user object database (marks, routes. etc.). No more wasted time searching your map for a marina; enter the name and it will be automatically located on the map. - SMART ZONE: Set up an alarm for when your boat enters or leaves specific areas on the nautical chart (e.g., restricted areas). Configure the types of affected to suit your preferences. Display NavData to see a list of all zones in which your boat is located. ATTENTION FISHERMEN! The following features have been developed especially for you: - BATHYVISION: Discover the best bottom data available and display it dynamically and intuitively in color and/or with contour lines. Adjust the contour lines’ density and shading to focus precisely on high-potential fishing areas. - EVENT AND CATCH: Save all your catches (weight, size, and photo) and build your fishing, seamlessly integrated with your nautical chart. - Access your data online and offline - Optional Radar and AIS modules Having access to the most accurate marine weather forecasts is crucial at sea, and TZ iBoat has you covered! - Free and unlimited GFS and WW3 marine weather forecasts - Download weather forecasts to use offline while at sea - Iridium GO!

      "description": "Navigate the city easily, whether you're driving, walking, or using public transport. With our GPS-powered app, you can see your precise location and get convenient directions straight to your destination wherever you are — in Dubai, Baku, or any other city. The app shows you directions that avoid traffic, tracks bus schedules, and knows all those fast, easy walking routes that take you around obstacles. With Yango Maps, you get a stress-free driving experience with real-time updates on the road and clear instructions on how to navigate complex intersections. You'll get warnings about traffic jams, road closures, and speed limits ahead of time so you'll definitely get there on schedule. The app will also direct you to parking and fuel stations near your destination so that nothing stands between you and the places you need to go. You can get directions even without an internet connection — simply download an offline map for your city or region, and you'll never get lost offline. Yango Maps is also available in CarPlay so you can see your route laid out in front of you as you drive. This currently works in the UAE and Azerbaijan, and we'll add support for more countries in upcoming updates. Feel free to contact us at app-maps@yango.com",
