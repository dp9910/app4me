      "description": "Upflix is a guide that helps you discover where your favorite movies and shows are available on the streaming platforms you already subscribe to. Upflix is great tool for keeping up with releases and discovering where to watch your favorite content on the largest streaming platforms. Your ultimate guide to movies and series on the major streaming services. If you're a subscriber to Netflix, Disney, Prime Video, Max, Hulu, or AppleTV, Upflix is perfect for you! With such a massive combined catalog (Netflix alone has 5000 titles), it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Upflix offers a solution that will impress you and help you navigate more efficiently. - Be the first to know: You'll receive notifications about content added to the platforms. If Netflix adds a new episode of the series you're watching, you'll know. If Prime Video adds a new movie to its catalog, you'll know that too. Upflix will keep you informed firsthand about the latest movies and series. Did you know that Netflix now has \"Band of Brothers\" and \"The Pacific\"? - User-friendly Guide: Upflix is a practical and simple guide. Everything is quick and straightforward, with no accounts or logins required. Just download and start using it. The only prerequisite is being a subscriber to Netflix or another streaming service that we support. - Expert Reviews: With Upflix, you'll have access to reviews and ratings from specialized websites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB, which will help you decide what to watch. If Netflix just released a series and you're not sure if it's good, just check Upflix! - Custom Lists: Upflix offers two different types of lists: a wishlist and a list of the series you're following. If you're watching \"The Witcher\" on Netflix and \"The Last of Us\" on Max, you can add both series and be notified whenever a new episode or season arrives. That way, you won't miss a thing. - Discover where to watch: Not sure on which platform your favorite movie or series is available? Our tool allows you to save time and find where to watch your favorite content. Did you know that \"Lord of The Rings\" is available on Netflix, Hulu, and Max? And that HBO's \"Ballers\" is on Netflix? Oh, did you hear that Netflix removed \"My Neighbor Totoro\"? The Roulette is a premium feature and requires a subscription to be used. The supported platforms are: Netflix, Max, Disney, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, AppleTV+, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll. All film-related metadata used in Upflix, including actor, director and studio names, synopses, release dates, trailers and poster art is supplied by The Movie Database (TMDB).
