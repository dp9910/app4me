      "description": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads! MyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day. One of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits. In addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map; our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States. MyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical Storm and Hurricane activity; you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded. In addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation. Download MyRadar today and try it out! * Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR) * Payments will be charged to your iTunes account * Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period * Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.

ADD LOCATION ON APPLE WATCH It’s handy to know that the first location added to your list is set as the location on your Apple Watch. To edit or change this, you can reorder the cities in your location overview on your iPhone. CHANGE MY BACKGROUND VIDEO Unfortunately, you can’t manually select a video to play as a background. The app selects a random video from a pool of weather videos that match the weather for the report you’re currently viewing. You can expand this pool of videos by unlocking videos in the menu screen, which is done by watching a short ad per video. YOUR EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT TO US!

      "description": "YOUR LOCAL WEATHER SERVICE WillyWeather organizes the world's weather data into the most valuable local information. The app includes radar, satellite, detailed wind, rain, tide, swell and UV forecasts, as well as moon phases, and sunrise and sunset times. Going beyond the average weather service, we process and fine-tune forecast data to the specific coordinates of thousands of locations including all suburbs, towns, beaches, rivers, parks, lakes and islands. WEATHER DATA • WEATHER - Six-day NOAA weather forecasts tailored to each location including min/max temperatures, and detailed weather descriptions. • RADAR - Raw NOAA radar data, refined, processed and integrated with iOS maps. • SATELLITE - National satellite view, displaying cloud cover for the entire US, integrated with iOS maps. • TIDES - The most comprehensive tide times system in the USA, bringing together NOAA standard port data with offsets generated for specific locations by WillyWeather. Includes every beach in the US, and many river systems and inlets. • WIND -The most accurate global wind forecast model gathered from NOAA, interpolated to the exact coordinates for each location, and vetted against real-time wind observations to deliver the best performing information. • UV - Hourly UV index forecasts, including alerts outlining extreme conditions when there is risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. • MOON PHASES - Full moon and new moon phases, illumination and rise and set times. Deeply integrated with tidal data. • RAINFALL - Intuitive visual indication of rainfall probability for the week ahead. • SWELL - Swell height, period and direction for each beach and surf spot in the USA. • SUNRISE SUNSET - Sunrise and sunset times with first light and last light. • REAL TIME observational data - with trends for all locations including current temperature, feels-like temperature, rain today, rain last hour, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, wind gusts and dew point. • NOAA WARNINGS - Easily accessible and specifically targeted to the locations affected. FEATURES • Interactive rainfall radar, using iOS maps: pan and zoom like you've always wanted through the national NOAA radar network, to see exactly where rain is falling around you, or your favorite locations. Our mapping features provide more control and detail than any other US weather resource. • Stunning, interactive tide, swell, and wind forecast graphs which allow you to easily interpret the conditions at your favorite surf beach, secret fishing spot or upcoming hike - in real-time, and up to seven days in the future. We're particularly proud of our graphs, we pushed the boundaries to provide you with more context, and more detail for each weather type. • A beautiful, simple and organized interface in which the weather data that is important to you is easy to find, consume, and interact with. Our goal was to present accurate and relevant weather information to you, as quickly, and easily as possible. Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

Then, we can integrate them into the app, where they’ll be seen by weather watchers all over the world (the app is available in over 50 languages). The app’s layout is customizable, allowing you to select what to display like rain, wind gust, pressure, UV index, etc. The Weawow is sustained by user donations.

      "description": "The in-depth meteorological reasoning and details behind your local weather forecast, straight from the experts at NOAA/NWS. Deep Weather provides the deep, detailed meteorological reasoning behind your forecast, along with the various factors that are likely to influence it. Knowing this deeper weather information arms you with the knowledge to anticipate weather changes and adjust your plans accordingly. Deep Weather respects your privacy. Deep Weather doesn't track or store your location information, or any other data about you. (See privacy disclosure below). Deep Weather has no ads that distract and clutter up your weather information. Rather it relies on optional Pro subscriptions from our loyal users to pay the bills. Deep Weather provides you with a deeper understanding of your weather forecast by giving you weather details not commonly found in other apps in a convenient, easy-to-read package. Deep Weather automatically compiles an easy-to-read version of the most recent National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussion, advisories and warnings for your location. The National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussions provide detailed information and background about the weather patterns and observations that are part of the most recent forecast model. They represent the \"Story behind the weather story,\" a glimpse behind the scenes of your current forecast, and provide lots of weather forecast detail not found anywhere else. Included sections: Aviation Weather Fire Weather Climatology Marine Weather Beach Forecast Watches, Warnings Short Term Forecast Long Term Forecast To help provide a more visual picture, Deep Weather also provides easy access to a curated list of the most up-to-date weather graphics: National Forecast Chart, Surface Analysis, IR Satellite, Current Radar, Pacific and Atlantic Ocean surface analysis, 500mb graphical forecasts and more. For Pro subscribers/owners, Deep Weather includes live animated radar rendered from National Weather Service source data. In addition, Deep Weather provides localized 7-day extended forecasts from the National Weather Service for any location in the United States and its territories. Deep Weather provides great value in helping you anticipate and adjust to changes in the weather that you might not have been aware of if limited to other weather sources. By understanding the factors and assumptions that are part of the official forecast and how changes in those factors could affect the outcome, you are armed with a much deeper and more flexible understanding of the weather around you. This is highly valuable in aviation, sailing, long distance hiking and any other outdoor endeavor where changes in the weather can have great impact. Use the map view to select any National Weather Service Forecast Office and receive the latest forecast discussion for that area. The discussion is broken up into sections for you, and the text itself formatted in a much more easily read format than the raw original. These discussions and weather graphics are amended and updated several times per day, so you can follow how the weather forecast is changing in real time, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the thought that goes into forming the forecast.

Although our expertise is audio, we are meteorologists, so we offer all the tools you need to stay informed. Up-to-the-minute radar that loads quickly and zooms in to your specific location. Storm vectors that illustrate current storm location and storm movement. We offer current weather advisory graphics with up-to-the-minute audio weather details for each bulletin.

      "description": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads! MyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default. MyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day. In addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map; our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States. MyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical Storm and Hurricane activity; you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded. One of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits. In addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.

      "description": "Hello Weather gives you beautiful, trustworthy forecasts powered by the best weather data on Earth. With hyperlocal real-time updates and a joyful design that’s easy to read at a glance, you’ll always be prepared for anything coming your way. Five reasons why you’ll love planning your day with Hello Weather... 1. All the info you need is right in your face. Our gorgeous, information-rich design shows you everything that matters in one simple screen. You’ll see the current conditions and future forecasts in an instant. 2. Simple on the surface. Details one tap away. Sometimes you need to dig deeper. Is it going to be windy enough to fly a kite today? When’s the best time to go? Just tap on the wind card (or any of our 12 data points) and you’ll see a super friendly specialized chart showing what’s what. 3. You’ll get predictions you can trust. Hello Weather is powered by the world’s best data sources, like Apple Weather, AccuWeather, Foreca, and The Weather Company. Pick the provider that's best in your area, or switch back and forth to compare. (Upgrade required.) 4. You don’t need to be a weather expert. What does barometric pressure mean? Is the dewpoint good or bad? We translated those esoteric stats into human words, so you’ll know how it really feels outside. 5. It’ll make you smile. We filled the app with tons of thoughtful little touches to brighten your day. You’ll love the beautiful color themes, automatic night mode, and sweet secret extras. And that's not all… • It works everywhere, from your phone to your wrist. Hello Weather is great on the iPhone or iPad, and when you’re on the go, our excellent widgets, notifications, and Apple Watch companion app will keep you updated proactively. • Radar’s built right in. When there's a storm front ahead, we've got your back. Our powerful radar tab shows you exactly what's headed your way. • Super duper customizable. Tune your app’s layout and appearance to your heart's content. Pick custom icon sets, themes, charts, data points, and tweak fiddly details if you want. It looks great in dark mode, too! • Made with care by a tiny indie company. We pour a lot of love into our app, and we take great care of our customers. We're always just an email away, and we're staunch defenders of your privacy. Here's what the experts say: \"An easy, straightforward weather app that shows you just what you need to know.\" — AppAdvice \"Hello Weather strips it down to the essence.\" — Macworld \"Very smart, with a clean layout and readable graphs. It eschews complexity without limiting information.\" — TechRadar \"One of my very favorites in recent years. It’s attractive, original, and highly useful.\" — Daring Fireball --- Hello Weather's free to use, but it's way better if you upgrade for the Pro stuff.
