Turn on notifications to tell you when your next period or fertile window is approaching. • Create a list of the medications, vitamins, and supplements you take, and receive reminders to log scheduled medications • Reflect on your state of mind by logging your momentary emotions, daily moods, and contributing factors. Get valuable insights into your state of mind and how it has changed over time with interactive charts. • Take standardized mental health assessments that are often used in clinics to understand your current risk for depression and anxiety and if you may benefit from a discussion with your care team. • Use the Health Checklist on iPhone to set up iPhone and Apple Watch to keep an eye on things for you. • See all your health records — such as allergies, immunizations, lab results, and more — in one place.* • Learn more about important health topics with educational articles. • When your phone is locked with a passcode, all your health and fitness data in the Health app — other than your Medical ID — is encrypted.

With MyChart you can: • Communicate with your care team. • Review test results, medications, immunization history, and other health information. • Connect your account to Apple Health to pull health-related data from your personal devices right into MyChart. • View your After Visit Summary® for past visits and hospital stays, along with any clinical notes your provider has recorded and shared with you. • Schedule and manage appointments, including in-person visits and video visits. • Get price estimates for the cost of care. • View and pay your medical bills. • Securely share your medical record from anywhere with anyone who has Internet access. • Connect your accounts from other healthcare organizations so you can see all your health information in one place, even if you've been seen at multiple healthcare organizations. • Receive push notifications when new information is available in MyChart. You can check whether push notifications are enabled under the Account Settings within the app. Select features are also available on Apple Watch. Note that what you can see and do within the MyChart app depends on which features your healthcare organization has enabled and whether they’re using the latest version of Epic software. If you have questions about what’s available, contact your healthcare organization. To access MyChart, you must create an account with your healthcare organization. To sign up for an account, download the app and search for your healthcare organization or go to your healthcare organization’s MyChart website. After you’ve signed up, turn on Face ID, Touch ID, or a four-digit passcode to quickly log in without needing to use your MyChart username and password each time. Then, make sure you have push notifications enabled to receive updates on your device when new information is available in MyChart.

WHOOP uses those insights to provide coaching based on your body’s unique physiology and recommends everything from when to go to bed to new daily behaviors that will help you reach your goals. If you’re new to WHOOP, you can try both the wearable and app free for 1 month. Terms and conditions apply. WHOOP is screenless, so all your data lives in the WHOOP app—for a distraction-free focus on your health. The WHOOP app requires a WHOOP wearable. How it works: Healthspan*: A powerful way to quantify your age and slow your Pace of Aging. Backed by leading longevity research, it pinpoints the daily habits that impact your long-term health. Sleep: WHOOP helps you understand how well you sleep each night by measuring your Sleep Performance. Every morning, WHOOP provides a Sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Planner calculates how much sleep you need to recover, tailored to your habits, schedule, and goals. You can even set a Haptic Alarm that wakes when you're fully rested, or at a specific time, with gentle vibration. Quality sleep is essential for improving your healthspan, metabolic mental resilience, recovery, and performance. Recovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You'll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 1 to 99%. When you're in the green, you're ready for strain, when you're in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program. Strain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity–it measures cardiovascular and muscular exertion to give you the most comprehensive view of the demands you put on your body. Each day, Strain Target will provide a Strain score from 0 to 21 and recommend your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score. Stress: WHOOP gives you daily insights to pinpoint your stressors, understand your physiological response, and discover techniques to help manage. Get a real-time stress score from 0-3 and, based on your score, choose a breathwork session to enhance your alertness or increase relaxation. Behaviors: WHOOP tracks over 160+ daily habits and behaviors—like alcohol intake, medication, and more—to better understand how these behaviors impact your body. WHOOP provides weekly guidance for behavior change and helps set accountability goals with the Journal and Weekly Plan features. WHOOP Coach: Ask questions about your health & fitness and get highly personalized, on-demand answers. Using your unique biometric data, the latest performance science, and generative AI, WHOOP Coach generates responses on everything from training plans to why you’re feeling tired. Menstrual Cycle Insights: Go beyond period tracking to better understand your fifth vital sign and get tailored cycle-based insights. What else you can do in the WHOOP app: • Dig into the details: See heart rate zones, VO₂ Max, steps, and more trends over time to adjust your behaviors, training, sleep and more based on your goals. • Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team's training is going. • Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple's Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience. WHOOP provides products and services designed for general fitness and wellness purposes. WHOOP products and services are not medical devices, not intended to treat or diagnose any disease, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

I lost 30 pounds. I had retired from boxing and came back to the sport with the support of my Vida coach – it’s unbelievable. I’m ready to jump back into the boxing ring again. I’m 40 years old, but feel like I’m 20.” - Mauricio “I'm proud to say I'm still smoke-free, breathing easy, and I've now lost 85 pounds. I'm more active than I've ever been.” - Lyndsey “I’m exercising daily and taking over 10,000 steps daily, which was foreign in the past. My diet has also completely changed, with more fruits and vegetables and grains. With these changes, I feel a lot more energetic and have clarity of mind.” - Chris, lost 25 pounds and reduced his elevated blood pressure “I feel empowered by being healthy, losing weight, going to the gym, cleaning my diet, and changing my perspective about life. I am happy again!” - Frank, lost 30 pounds and reversed his diabetes",
